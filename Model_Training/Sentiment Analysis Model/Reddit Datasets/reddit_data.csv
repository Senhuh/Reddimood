"Changes to r/RandomThoughts are coming Hey friends, Just informing all of you that we're in the process of changing some rules to make them easier to understand. Please be on the lookout for that over the coming days. If you have any ideas that you think should be implemented please let us know in the comments here."
Pretend it's Monday...I didn't lie 😅 We have plans in place to begin using r/randomquestions (also owned by us) to restore this subreddit to specifically just random thoughts. The questions flair we have here was only supposed to be temporary and was never supposed to be permanent in any capacity. As of right now you are welcome to continue posting your questions here but that may change in the near future. Any questions posted here after we remove the questions flair will be removed and you will be redirected to r/randomquestions.

"saying “cock” instead of “dick” is so cringe / funny to me IM SORRY BUT IT IS. i can not sit there and say cock without laughing.

I have barely any self confidence and I've never really gotten compliments, no one pays much attention to me, and I'm not overweight, but I definitely have a few kg's  more than the other women around me, so do people think I'm ugly or do I just not get the attention others get?"

Edit: Adding onto the question, I’m in college and I see guys with attractive women. If they find me attractive, what makes me different from the other women they interact with?"

i often forget that behind every random text from a user is a person with hopes and dreams. maybe someone who also cant sleep. and has some struggles. man i hope we figure it all out. best be getting some sleep soon tho.
"Do you make up an excuse if you cancel plans for feeling down/depressed or do you tell the truth? Personally, I feel guilty or like it’s not a valid excuse so I end up just saying I’m not feeling well, which technically isn’t a lie but most assume that means you’re sick. "
"Why doesn't my phone's photo gallery widget show my NSFW photos? Not that I want it to. But I just realised that the widget on my phone seems to never show nudity, or even anything suggestive.

"I wish we could get statistics on our own lives Anything from random ones to more serious ones. Just a few examples I thought about:

What movie have I watched the most? 
How many times did I miss dying just because I was a second too late/too early or turned left instead of right? 
How many times have someone thought of me and missed me? 
How many times did I use the word “like” when my brain failed me and I needed a second to regroup? 
Which song did I listen to the most including the times when an algorithm couldn’t answer me that on a yearly basis? 

Like full random stuff. It would be so entertaining, would keep me busy for hours on end. The best but most useless superpower I would choose for sure. "
"I love seeing myself through a photographers eyes… I did a photoshoot a while back, and each photo I didn’t like I was hypercritical of. The ones I liked were heavily staged from what I’ve been doing in photos since I was probably 13 (I’m 27) now. 

The photographer just sent me all the photos. And sent me ones by hand that he loved, describing why he liked them. I remember they were when I was more relaxed or not quite paying attention. All I saw was: “why is my nose that big? My smile is terrible. Am I that fat from that angle?” And other typical thoughts. But he went through what he liked.

And honestly, I just can’t hate the photos anymore. It was sweet to hear and why. "
"Are there people that put with health issues for the sake of their partners? I'm actually wondering about this since I recently got diagnosed with PTSD (by a licensed therapist not tiktok) due to something food related and my sensitivity to heat (weather) and I was actually curious if there are people that would be patient or understanding of issues like this.

In the summer I understand that I can be a burden since I need shadow breaks and coolness rather often to not faint and I understand that not many would put up with this but like- are there people that would or do you guys think it's too much of a mental strain"

"Who is asking for all this AI? Recently, I noticed thousands of companies rushing to use AI products, but who is using it? How is it helpful? Could anyone provide some insight here as I think it distorts news, writing, and art. I'm confused as to why people are jumping on this bandwagon when all of the current tech we have is fine except for the occasional crash. I also understand that people with disabilities may benefit from AI voice recognition, but is there really anything else that AI helps with?"
I wonder what all the hollerers and yellers who start popping up in my crappy neighborhood when the tempts rise Do with all the racket during the cold months.

How to shop in the women’s section with more confidence? I’m a straight male and I’ve stared this new way of life. Where clothes don’t have a gender attached to them I want to wear what ever I want with in reason of course like I wouldn’t wear dresses skirts or crop tops. I just can’t get over the thought of being judge for shopping in the women’s.

"My appearance doesn’t match my personality. I look outwardly tough (at least in my mind I do) but I don’t act like I am. I’m the shyest, dorkiest, most socially awkward person I know. People can hardly hear me when I speak sometimes and they forget I’m even there. I’m not exactly proud of it, but that’s how I am, and at 23-years-old I don’t think my personality can change.

"I can't see the stars It's so weird. I live on a college campus. Everyone can see the stars but me so it's not like there's too much light and no one can.

I was stargazing with a friend a couple years ago. I saw maybe two tiny dots of light, but they saw way more. Once while I was walking at night with another friend I acknowledged that the night sky didn't have stars. He looked at me like I had two heads. He said there were a lot of stars in the sky, but I saw none.

I still don't see stars in the sky. I've seen them at home, but not here at college. Everyone else sees the stars here and I don't. It's so bizarre."

"Why is free thinking soo opposed? No one wants unbiased opinions, there’s too many sheep Iknow i sound like the guy that everyone disagrees with and im butt hurt but that’s not the case lol im being honestly genuine here….seems like ppl just want to fall in line with whatever the most common status quo is instead of approaching the subject at hand from all different points of view instead of shunning the matter due to personal disinterest, unpopularity, subconscious-associations, fear-of-judgement etc. 

I know for a certainty that many dislike or fear the idea of free thought unbiased opinions because of the future ramifications for what it could signify for what they believe reality to be. 

Yup thats what it is i answered my own question through my randomness of ongoing rambling in my head.

“People dislike things that destroy reality as they know it/how they make sense of things big or small. They don’t hate it for the inherent qualities but for what it could signify. 

Nobody likes to be wrong."

"I wonder how many people have VPNs, because now is the time to get one. If we get media blackouts, access to regular sources of information may be geo-blocked.

VPN secures your privacy/location, jumps over those geo-blocks, and keeps you connected.

I'd pick an EU one. Have been using VPNExpress myself for years and it works well, but there's lots of choices.

Better to have it and not need it, than to need it and not have it."
"Seeking hope Our dog Willow stopped eating Friday and started throwing up around the same time but just a little so we thought ahead might be sick because we’ve been sick for like 3 weeks and she’s seemed a little off since we got sick and also around that time she got her rabies vaccination. She is up to date on everything and we try to take the best care of her..she’s definitely spoiled in all forms and fashion. We hardly take our eyes off of her except when she’s in our backyard. We both work from home and she loves being outside. She also loves to lick toads and eat random yard flowers/grasses, etc. .keep in mind her labs were normal 4 weeks ago..her labs yesterday at the vet was 12 for her creatinine and her BUN was off the charts and today (24ish hours later) her BUN was 230 and 13.5 on her creatinine but that was with 1 Subcutaneous and a anti nausea medication. She had also taken her dose of amoxicillin and 2 anti nausea pills last night and today. She is now at a ICU with fluids, electrolytes and IV antibiotics for at least till tomorrow to see if she is improving. Has anyone gone through this and has their baby gotten any better? Thanks ..looking for hope "

"Instead of assuming common sense, we should assume common ignorance. Instead of assuming everyone just should know something, it makes more sense to assume common ignorance.

"Why don't we have Translation Clubs in schools and universities so that they can build experience being translators and practice different languages? This can be incorporated into language specific clubs like French Clubs to give them things to do. A list of.. (continued in post) ...most wanted books to be translated can be added with a thumbs up rating to see which ones really are wanted more. Maybe, these clubs can be paid per book they translate (as long as they don't use AI services). These can include children's books to even novel series. This can even introduce new ideas to different parts of the world that could help with democracy or human rights. Of course, we'd have to message the author(es(ses) if they want their book translated. (Sorry had to repost for a grammar fix)"

"I hate the term ""affordable housing"" I really hate hearing about affordable housing.  It's such a big lie.  It's only for people who make below a certain amount.

"Why do they call different people races but different animals coats colourings Pugs, collies are different species. A blue or brindle great dane is not a different species, they are different outer colour.. you don't call a brindle a different species than a blue great dane.. race doesn't exist, you can track it genetically, but you likely could also track coat colour genetically, or which region they were from if you got more in depth with that breed genome.. but no one wants to spend 15 years decoding each dog genome unless they were done or very close to finishing human for research purposes.. but by then we'll likely be on mars.

Neanderthal, denisovans, homosapians.. different species, Spanish, Indian, different colouring.. 

Brindle, blue, is not a race. Neither is anything else. You're either a person, or you don't exist anymore.. from being extinct. If you exist, you're a person.. great, but don't get caught up on semantics when you could dumb it down to something similar when it's arbitrarily pointing to Species.. than colouring.. fucking stupid, I am of the curly hair race, how bout you? Sounds stupid too.. but you could probably track where that specific kind of curly mainly populated to, so Hey why not. Same hair, now the same race.. now we can figure that out. And how to argue about that"

"Do you know what keeps reddit ahead of it's competitors? Well, unlike many other popular social media platforms, redditors tend to be more at peace with commenting and sharing their two cents. On the contrary, users on other SM platforms are used to scrolling and keep doing it, at times they hot the like icon and then move on, for commenting is something they least bothered about.

"Have I fallen for a scam! Sometimes, I look at those people who don’t take life seriously, barely studying, staying up all night, sleeping half the day, and just… existing. And you know what? They seem so much happier than the ones grinding non-stop to build a career, chase dreams, and ""secure a future"" (which, apparently, is me).

And then I wonder… was choosing ambition a mistake? Maybe life’s secret cheat code is not having goals. Imagine the peace of mind! No stress, no deadlines, just pure, blissful ignorance. Meanwhile, here I am, overworked, underslept, and probably aging faster than I should.

Honestly? I lowkey envy the carefree ones. They might not have a five-year plan, but at least they have eight hours of sleep.

"The movies Do you go to the movies alone, with someone or with multiple people? 

I went to the movies with a friend one time and she talked through the whole freaking movie. I wanted so bad to tell her ""Will you STFU"" and watch the movie. I paid to see the movie not to listen to you. I was pissed.😡😤 I can't stand when ppl talk during a movie. 

Needless to say, I now go to the movies alone, so I can enjoy it.

How do you manage loneliness/ living alone? I’m in my mid 20’s and very family oriented. I really dislike being alone. I received a job offer for a huge amount/gov access and it’s going to require me to be 2 hours away from family and friends. I’ve tried two times before to live away from family and ended up coming back after 6 months. So how can I manage? Should I take that job or the one that’s a 20k price cut just to be around family?  How do you manage living alone?

"What is the purpose of good looks? 
I am considered fairly attractive by most people and I have seen it to be of effect in many places. For eg., people letting me off for being clumsy or being receptive towards me or just generously helping me with things which I can do myself. 
Some ~12 years ago, I posted a simple picture which gained a LOT of likes and comments in just 2 days. This gave me an idea that I could gain a lot if i pursued on that path. By a lot I mean.. followers, influence and then money.. the deal.

In the recent times, I have seen many girls profit off their good looks in many ways. This also includes landing a rich guy, influencing people to have their way or making big money if they are willing to strip for the camera, what not.

I have stirred clear of this. I am not on any social media, I don’t look for guys with money, I have been in the social service line since I graduated and I don’t let myself get off unfairly for something I have done wrong even if I see the person in front of me is willing to.

Recently my parent who has a clothing line wants to profit off my looks and wants me to pose and talk pleasingly and make short videos to pull in business. I do not want to do this.

This has got me to wonder, what good are looks for if you don’t want to use it to manipulate or profit off of in any way?"
"My Two Contradicting Minds I often experience two conflicting thoughts in my head one part of me supports an idea while another part disagrees. After doing some research, I learned that this feeling is called **cognitive dissonance**. This theory was introduced by Leon Festinger in 1957 and explains the mental discomfort we feel when our beliefs or actions conflict.

We all face situations like this. For example, we value loyalty and honesty, yet sometimes we may not tell the complete truth. Or we know eating junk food isn’t healthy, but many of us still do it. Often, we even defend our own ideas or those of people we care about, even when we might be wrong.

So, how can we deal with this inner conflict? Based on my own experience, I believe that experiencing cognitive dissonance is a natural part of life it comes and goes, just like birth and death. Instead of trying to avoid it (which can actually cause more stress), we should learn to work with it. It can offer a fresh perspective and challenge our old beliefs, which is a chance to grow and learn.

some simple steps that have helped me:

1. **Self-Reflection:** Take time to think about your thoughts and feelings. Understanding why you feel conflicted is a good first step.
2. **Clarify Your Emotions:** Organize your thoughts and try to understand what exactly is bothering you.
3. **Meditation:** This can help calm your mind and provide a clearer perspective.

I hope you find these ideas helpful!

"what did you do when you get your fist paycheck ? I remember why first paycheck, it was the first time i got some money, some good money for my own.

Of course, before splurging, i did put aside rent money and bills, but i had some money left and i really wanted to buy something nice and treat myself.

So i went to the mall, saw a movie, had some burger king, got a brand new ps3 game and bought me a nice watch. I think the brand new leather watch with the big thick strap was my first ever splurge, i always loved seeing actors on tv wearing that bulky watch with the thick leather strap so it was the first thing i ever did with my own money, but that watch and it served me well for many years.

Also, i got a chicken whopped meal from burger king, i know this will sound crazy, but it was the best burger i ever had, because it was the first meal i paid for it with my own money, i swear until this day, i can still remember how delicious it was, just knowing i earned that food.

So how about you ?"

"Most people walk around like puppets. Most people in western culture walk around like puppet on a string, , reacting and complaining .

Getting offended, exploding in anger because someone said something or did something 

They let other control their emotions like a remote control. 

Weak slavery of the mind. 

EVERYTHING YOU FEEL, anger, frustration, irritation, offense, is a choice and most people don't even realize it. They go through life reacting like puppets thinking EMOTIONS happen TO THEM but that's the greatest lie that's ever been sold. 

No one forces anger into your mind or injects frustration into your veins 

YOU DO IT. YOU ALLOW IT. YOU PARTICIPATE IN IT AND THAT MEANS YOU CAN STOP IT

Most people live in a prison of their own making, blaming their emotions on the outside world. 

""She disrespected me "" "" they shouldn't have said that"".WEAK THINKING. SMALL THINKING. 

A mindset of a person that will never be free because the moment you say someone else made you angry, you are admitting they control you, literally. You're admitting your emotions are of that of a puppet and the world holds the strings and that's simply pathetic because the truth is YOU HOLD THE STRINGS

AND YOU ALWAYS WILL"

But for another person to call you that unprompted is just insulting. It's such a stupid slang, it's basically saying you're not good enough to be the main course.

"Can humans truly create something from nothing? Or are we just assembling pieces of something that already exists on some level? I don’t know. I was just wondering—can a highly intellectual, creative, and curious person truly create something out of thin air? No inspiration, no reference to an existing concept—just *poof!*—an idea, a concept entirely their own?

Think about time travel, unicorns, astral projection, and all those wild ideas we see in movies, games, and books. What if the idea that “nothing is impossible” is *actually* true? Maybe we just haven’t tapped into those possibilities yet—or worse, maybe they were forgotten truths.

That’s why I ask—have humans ever truly come up with these concepts on their own? Like, did they just *appear* in someone’s mind out of nowhere? Or is everything we create, even the most outlandish ideas, always inspired by *something*?

I don’t know. Maybe I’m just not that smart, but I’ve always believed that every concept, every idea, comes from something else.

"Glinda is the villain of the Wizard of Oz Based purely on MGM’s The Wizard of Oz, I have concluded that Glinda is the true villain of the movie, not the Wicked Witch of the West.

The facts:

1. Glinda magically took the ruby slippers from the Wicked Witch of the East and put them on Dorothy, this unprepared girl, making Dorothy a target. 

2. Doesn’t tell Dorothy the slippers could send her home “because you wouldn’t have believed me.” This is ridiculous, Dorothy was told they had power, shocking the Wicked Witch of the West when she tried to take them.

3. She sends Dorothy to the Emerald City by foot, putting her in danger.

4. The only time she helps Dorothy is when she’s put to sleep by the poppies. 

Now, what occurs as a result of the events of the movie?

1. The Wicked Witches of the East and Wesr are killed.

2. The Wizard returns back to Kansas from Oz.

Who benefits from that? I say Glinda does. She has all of her competition removed, leaving her free to take over Oz herself.

I suspect she even talked the Wizard into cooperating with her in the first place.

Conjecture: 

Glinda wanted more power. She needs threats to that power removed. She comes up with a plan: bring a patsy from our world to Oz and get her to do the dirty work.

She directs Dorothy’s house to land on WWE, to start the chain of events. She knows Dorothy can’t do it on her own and makes sure she has backup.

She keeps an eye on things to make sure Dorothy gets to the Emerald City so the Wizard can send her to kill WWW.

Then while they are at WWW’s castle, Dorothy accidentally spills water on WWW, killing her… but why would WWW even have water in her castle at all? I suspect Glinda planted it there. 

So the wicked witches are dead, the Wizard leaves Oz, Dorothy is sent home, and there’s a power vacuum left in Oz for Glinda to fill. 

By the way, the whole “it was just a dream” thing was just Glinda messing with Dorothy’s mind… and probably had the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion resemble the farm hands… and maybe made Gulch look like the witch. 

And the ruby slippers probably stayed in Oz, too, so Glinda could gain their power."

Many times I read on platforms like reddit women saying or answering things like ""Men don't have to expect women to fight for their need"". It's something I deeply agree with, and I respect women a lot because they are actually fighting to make their lives better.

The thing that I don't understand is why, when a man accept this kind of suggestion and expose a issue related to himself as a man or men in general, or try to explain why the issue is related not only to women but to men too, he gets mocked, downvoted etc.

It looks to me really hypocritical, but I'm totally open to (civil) different points of view."

"Quick Recovery So I'm an over weight 35M, horrible diet and drink way too much. I also work big construction jobs, So I'm not the least bit shocked that I get sick more often than the average person. 

The weird part is that I find myself on the flip side in terms of recovery when I am sick, I tend to recover far quicker than the average person. This is most apparent with things like Covid and the Flu, which is usually symptom relieved within hours-a day. ( Not vaccinated). 

I figured with my lifestyle that I must have bad immunity system, thus the frequency of being ill. But if I heal so quickly, does that mean a good immune system? None of it makes sense! "

what’s everyone up to this weekend? anything fun? or just relaxing? 
"Weekend and no friends It's Sunday, and i am not going anywhere, although it's a big match today (Ind vs Pak) today but it's the story of every weekend, i get couple of days, Saturday & Sunday.

No friends call me on weekend, or make plans with me, as if i am non-existent, may be they are busy with their other plans, but, 

Are they busy every Sat-Sun for consecutive months?

May be i have less friends or may be i don't fit in their groups.. or, it's just me who think they are my close friend but they don't think i am their close friend.

Finally a conclusion that i have,
I guess some of my friends have plans or they are tired from their week's work & just resting at home..

But others are just like me laying in bed feeling alone and thinking others friends are busy, 
which also includes me in their 'busy friends' list and then they think 'i Shouldn't disturb them'.."

"You know you’re having a good laugh when you cannot breathe We know this feeling when one of your friends crack a joke whilst hanging out. One laugh turns to multiple laughs and minutes later everyone is having a great time. I can recall times where I would laugh for a good fifteen seconds nonstop. I would still be laughing, but then it was too good. Next thing I know I can’t breathe because of all the oxygen leaving my lungs. In a panic at this point I would calm myself down by lowering my sore cheek muscles, combined with deep and slow breathes. Laughs are fun and all until you realize you’re running out of oxygen. Even though this is the case, it’s still a good laugh to have. "

"Undercover Boss How was the “Undercover Boss”  show on for 15 yrs or whatever it was?. 

And your telling me that one day you’re working at a fast food place and you hear that a new employee is coming in but for only about two weeks and then he shows up and you know immediately it’s the UB because he has the WORST disguise on ever. 

Then 5 min into his shift he suddenly doesn’t know how to make the french fries like they should be made (even though he’s the one that invented them) so he then gets berated by the 20 yr old mgr who smells like weed and is getting jacked up on energy drinks, all shift. 

   Then lunch comes around and him and the one other employee are just randomly eating lunch in the break room talking about nothing.  Then he comes out with the same thing “so Tell me about your family?” And guess what? The 26 yo girl tells how she beat cancer at 7yr old but at 12 the family house burnt down because they had to heat their home by leaving the burners on the stove burning all night long.  So she had to live on the streets and do things she did not want to do to survive after that for a year. Finally she says she got her GED and wants to be a nurse but just in the last yr her mother was paralyzed after getting hit by a car and the motorized wheelchair the insurance bought her caught on fire and they can’t afford to pay for another one. So now mom lays in bed and somehow has started huffing paint but lies about it even though she has a gold paint ring around her nose mouth every night And if that’s not enough, the employee still has no idea who her dad is and mom is getting all whacked out on huffing paint when the girl asks get serious with her and says she really wants to know who her dad is mom just yells “get out of my room. You disappoint me!”

And we all know the end he ends up getting them a new home mom new wheelchair and gets her off huffing all that paint by sending her to the $10,000 a week passages of Malibu recovery program. And the employee is given $100,000 in cash a new house and has a scholarship at some technical college named after her. The saddest part is you look her up to see where she is now and she is homeless again because Covid happened and her mom and her got so bored they started huffing paint and duster constantly that they both now are whacked out of their mind. She now spends her days picking up smoked cigarette butts off the highway median and putting them in her pocket to smoke later.  Who knows where mom is and she’s stopped asking about who her dad is or was. Because through all her pain, she is finally realized that she is a disappointment yet last heard from her she vowed to get back on track. Whatever that means!!!!

"Being Very Attractive Comes with a Price – Does Anyone Else Feel This Way? **Who This Question Is For**

This isn’t for people who get called cute or attractive by their partners or friends. I’m talking to those who experience a different level of attractiveness—the kind where:

	•	Strangers randomly stop you just to say you look good, then walk away.


	•	You can predict when a group of the opposite sex will make a commotion when you walk by.


	•	You get anxiety from all the staring, to the point where it makes you not want to go outside.


	•	People assume you’re arrogant just because of how you look.

	•	At the gym, you can’t just work out—someone will stare or try to start a conversation.

	•	At work, coworkers treat you differently, 
either extra nice or weirdly standoffish.

	•	Some people straight-up look at you like an object for their pleasure, not a person with thoughts and boundaries.

**The Sexual Objectification Problem**

This one really bothers me. I come from a race/ethnic group of men who I’ve found are very sexually objectified by women.

When I was younger, I thought that was cool—I didn’t fully understand what was happening. But now, at 32, I’ve gotten much wiser, and I see the implications of it.

It REALLY bothers me when I catch women looking at me like I’m just a walking dildo—like I exist purely for their sexual fantasies and should be grateful for their attention.

For women, I imagine this is like when certain men see them as nothing more than a sex doll—just something to use and discard, with no real interest in who they are as a person. That’s exactly how it feels, and it’s dehumanizing.

**The Harsh Reality **

While it’s flattering (and I’d never trade places with an ugly person in a million years), it’s bothersome knowing that people treat you well only because they find you attractive.

Because deep down, you know:
	•	If you were born ugly, people would treat you completely differently—sometimes even cruelly.

	•	If you ever got into a freak accident that ruined your face, your life would completely change.

	•	You’d be banned from ever sleeping with beautiful people again, and if you’re lucky, some equally unattractive person might take you in.

**I really wish the world wasn’t like this.**

Yes, Being Attractive Has Benefits—But There’s a Price to Pay

I’m not denying the advantages of being attractive. I’m obviously glad that women are attracted to me and that I’m not forced to be an incel over something I can’t control.

But people don’t talk about the downsides enough:
	•	You can never just blend in.

	•	There’s always SOME stranger who wants to interact with you, even when you just want to be left alone. And it happens frequently.

	•	People feel entitled to your time. They assume you should be friendly 24/7.

	•	Rejecting someone feels extra uncomfortable because they assume you’re out of their league.

	•	Random people, sometimes complete strangers, feel the need to touch you—whether it’s your arm, hair, or back.

	•	And the worst one—people sexualizing you in a way that strips you of your humanity.

"Companies don’t care about employees, they just care about themselves Back in 2016, I met with an accident and fractured my ankle. I was advised to take bed rest for 3 months followed by physiotherapy. It was pre covid times and work from home was not a thing. My company refused to provide work from home and asked me to take leave without pay if my paid leaves are exhausted. I didn’t argue as it was company policy.

Few days later, there was some urgent work which required my help and they not only allowed me to work from home, they sent my work laptop home with the support staff. (Yes we left work laptop in office. Company policy)

After having this experience early in my career, I realised that Organisations don’t care about employees, all rules can be ignored when its their need but they wont be even a little flexible for the employee.

"Why do kids still use school books instead of an E reader? I know things vary a bit depending on area/region, but in a lot of areas kids are still carrying school books to school in a backpack. Some schools still allow backpacks. Some require them to be clear. Others vary. But it seems that even though a lot of kids have Chromebook or laptops, there’s still a lot of places that they have textbooks as well.

It’s 2025. Why in the world do schools not simply have textbooks downloaded onto an E reader or tablet, where the kids just carry that? Was this a huge missed opportunity by Amazon or some other company, where years ago they could’ve created a school E reader And heavily pushed it?

I mean by college they would still find a way to make profits from books and just charge a ton of money for the download, so it’s not like college kids would save a lot of money. But younger kids in primary schools could save their backs and it would be a lot safer than carrying around pounds of books and supplies."

"i love music music is the one thing that absolutely everyone can discuss and even bond over. music is expressive. it’s creative. songs and even some artists can save/ saved peoples lives. there’s a million different styles and types, artists, etc. music has definitely changed the world id say. i can’t explain it. it makes everything brighter. even when you’re sad about something specific, i’m sure there’s a song out there for it. for clubs, to weddings, to funerals, there’s a song for everything. or a genre for everything. sometimes music speaks louder than actual words, if that makes sense. some songs just blow my mind with how the lyrics are being written and the message being sent. idk i think about it a lot, just how great it is.

"Commercials I don’t trust commercials. The advertisements are made to motivate you and get you to buy things and they talk about how amazing the products are.The product could be terrible and possibly harmful but they’ll say it’s great. Of course the commercials are biased because it’s their product (duh) so they wouldn’t tell us and they’d lie to us about it just to make a sale. I don’t trust the commercials where they bring in actors, celebrities or athletes either bc of course they’re being paid to say what the company wants and they wouldn’t say anything negative about whatever they’re selling. I have a tendency to trust products from people on social media platforms that aren’t being sponsored or payed to promote them. If they’re recommending a product without being payed or something like that and are just doing it because they genuinely like the product I’ll be waaayyy more likely to buy or invest in it. "

"I love the way strangers bond over the randomest of things I’ve been going to the gym for the past 5 months and the first few weeks, I was just doing my workout and leaving. A few weeks in though, I started to recognise the regulars. Soon, it progressed to nodding and smiling at them when I see them. Then, it was random compliments from them on my form or improvements in body, or a PR. Now, I’m friends with two or three people and on smiling terms with half the gym in my time slot. 

That got me thinking, I never knew these people beforehand. I wouldn’t have given them the time of the day if we passed each other by outside. But because we regularly go the gym at the same time, we are now friends and acquaintances. It’s really endearing, the way we form bonds with people over the most random things.

"Ever wondered if all the meat you ever ate was the kind of meat you thought it was? I'm no vegetarian, and I probably never will be, but sometimes certain things I've eaten and certain places I've eaten at sort of haunt me a little bit. Not necessarily in an extreme way that keeps me up at night or anything, but definitely in a way that made me stop eating certain dishes at certain restaurants.

For example, one time my friend introdced me to this new chicken chain that sold these crazy huge drumsticks. I'm talkin' turkey leg sized chicken drumsticks. They didnt taste weird or anything, but the next time I went to that restaurant and every time I've been since that first time, the wings and drumsticks have all been normal sized and no matter where I look online in reviews or pictures or advertisements for this chain - nobody else ever mentions those giant, turkey leg sized drumsticks...

Had a similar experience at another place, known for their spicy chicken. The first time I went there it tasted great, but then this one time I ordered from the same place on DoorDash and it just tasted all wrong. The flavor was off, the consistency was off, and even the smell was kinda strange. Like nothing I've ever eaten before. It was all rubbery and tasted kinda fishy and it smelled like piss. Threw it away after the first bite.

Anyone else ever have an experience like that with food, where it was randomly way bigger out of nowhere, or the taste/smell/texture of the food was just wrong or off somehow?"

We use them for essentially everything, and are extremely dependent on them for a lot of things. Communication, financial’s, food, entertainment, wellness, health, love, etc.


Most of the time we pull them out of our pocket, unlock it, and open an app, it’s not even a conscious decision. One thing I think is really sad is how so many kids are growing up and literally having their brain developed around technology 24/7. It’s not healthy, it’s artificial. While they may have a lot of benefits, I’ve noticed so many teenagers are anti-social as fuck, and pull out their phone as soon as the conversation is getting to an end. Staring blankly at a screen completely ignoring the humans around you, because of how much of a dopamine surge you get from different things on your phone.

People are literally *bullied* and made fun of for having a different brand than the more popular one (Android & iPhone.) We place so much importance and trust into these metal blocks with light. "

"Economic system. Any economists and the like here? What if the govt had a system set up akin to Share. You voluntarily sign a contract to work in public service with a graduated benefit upon completion of time or quantity. Areas of employment may narrow down to community needs. Benefits may or may not be available until contract completion. Benefits include part money, part food, part medical care, part housing. These parts vary each and range from some percentage graded scale (not 100% at all for short contracts). Some also not available until longer contracts are completed. You of course can persue other methods of making a living as well. Depending on system viability, the final retirement benefits may or may not afford 100% for longer contracts."

"The dilemma of a passionate person is not knowing which passion to pursue. When you're passionate, you love and want to do everything. You want to pursue everything. You want to try everything. And you fall in love with not just one, but several things. I love martial arts, Go (board game similar to chess), violin, drawing, and writing. I chose martial arts and Go, because I only have the time, energy, and finance for TWO passions. But gosh damn, I feel like I am neglecting a part of my soul by choosing to give up on learning the violin. It takes years, lots of practice, and $$$ to be good at it, so I decided it better to quit early on. I don't have room or money for it in my life :(. I had to choose.

If their goal is to get people to join their cause, I feel like being so disruptive and obtrusive would only serve to drive people away, who didn’t previously feel strongly one way or the other."

I know there is actually a lot of very meaningful, symbolic art, but people seem to have forgotten that not every drawing wants to force a profound opinion onto the recipient. And as an artist myself I'm getting mad at artists who give these boastful, highbrow titles to their pieces, just so that they seem to hold more meaning.

"Ghosted/blocked my best friend 32 years old male for context* 

Last summer i completely ghosted and blocked my ""best"" friend. Actually he was my only friend. My only social life for years outside my relationship with my wife, occasionally i meet her friends (we live together so its inevitable). If that counts as a social life. 

I miss having someone to go to the cinema with , play pool or shoot some hoops with and talk about life and having deep insightful conversations with 

However I had to distance myself from this friend because he just changed completely 
And started constantly criticising me and even talking negatively about me behind my back and sharing stuff i had told him as secrets in private. Personal Sensitive stuff. 

So he used to be an introvert like me and I was his only friend as well. Difference is, he felt insecure about it. He started doing cocaine and became very social , he started going to groups and clubs and made many friends. I was happy for him for making friends but his whole personality changed. He became arrogant, insincere, hyper critical. 

He would sometimes manage to drag me along to meet some of these guys, these new friends. 

They were extremely immature.. talking about girls they had fucked etc.. i didn't resonate nor relate to their lifestyle and way of thinking at all .. he was Addicted to posting everything on social media and even posted a picture of me with him without my consent. He was also Addicted to online dating. So when I was with just him alone he was glued to his phone. 

Then little by little he started criticising me constantly for not being social, for not wanting to party and for not being normal as he put it

And when I found out he was talking shit about me behind my back several times 
I started seeing him more like a bully (someone who gets a kick out of talking down to others) than a friend. 

Sometimes I regret ghosting him because he regularly tries to contact me. He even called my mom ( we had been friends since we were in 3rd grade) i still didn't call him back 

And sometimes the no social life can be painful as a 32 year old guy 

But I dont think I should settle with fake friends just to have a social life. 

I think very likely he has no idea why i ghosted him. "

"There will never be a world without strife. The world, the universe itself is a shifting constant. Some believe a better world is possible with technology or faith, but our discomfort is result of natural processes that fractally expand on an infinite nature. How we stop earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, and any other primal calamity. Can we do this without disrupting an action with cause without any consequence. Do you dream of the end of disease? Viruses, bacteria, protist, fungi, parasites of all kind share the same carbon chain we do. Their extinction is our end. How about cancer? Can we truly master biology? Because it takes mastering physics. We are not subject to the world, we are among it. Our empty towers are just rocks on top of each other. Our vehicles rely on the legacy of this planet for fuel. And between us we will never solve love, because that would make it duty instead. And the only way to let go is to embrace it."

All they do is talk about food and how they refrain from junk food and don't get me wrong I am all for healthy eating but their obsessions are just put of control and I am tired.

I “cancelled” the membership once the break ended and I got an email saying the confirmed the cancellation with no other info in the email.

"Is this what the magic of coffee really is? So I'm a guy who usually doesn't get many headaches or mind forg when I wake up. If I'm up then I'm up and almost fully functioning in my job or whatever, sure a little groggy for a few mins but then I'm like Okie dokie can start work or whatever.

But today I felt tired and had a headache even after getting good night's sleep yesterday. And i really needed to work on something important so can't take a long break.

So I thought of trying out some coffee and kid you not, within 15-30 mins I'm back to working like normal. I mean is this what people feel everyday?

Obviously I've had coffee before, even when I'm in the office but it rarely does anything substantial for me in terms of productivity, it's only the taste that I like. 

So, this is just a dumb discovery for me of why other people need coffee, couldn't really understand what they meant by this. I just liked the taste similar to any other beverage."

"Most women I’ve dated have been sexually assaulted I was thinking and I’ve noticed that I seem to attract women that have been sexually assaulted in the past. They normally open up about it surprisingly quick, and I always listen and provide consolation. I hope it’s not because the statistics of sexual assault is just that high, which if that’s the case is incredibly sad and just goes to show how fucked up this world is"
Thinking About Art Art is all about choices. A program follows a set of instructions and can't make choices anymore than a river can choose to be redirected. I studied computer science in college and have familiarity with coding. There's a big difference between someone making art and someone telling AI to make art. The AI is not conscious and can't make choices.

"Every elementary should be language immersion Teaching kids a second language in high school is usually too late.  Do some learn, oh yes, and I'm infinitely jealous.  

But imagine your school district, where one school is German language immersion, one Spanish, one Chinese, one French, one Arabic and one Italian (as examples). 

Will these kids all learn to speak English?? You can bet they will.  In the US, there's really no getting away from it.   But these kids would all be speaking a second language with a good accent before they hit puberty. It's much easier to learn a language at an early age. 

I'm guessing somewhere in the US, there are individual schools that have done the heavy work and created a curriculum for each of my language examples, and surely others.  

Does anyone know of a school district that has done a few languages? "
"Was watching death note( a mystery-thriller series) with my sister and she dropped a thought on me? She said "" imagine if you were given a similar type of notebook, but instead of writing a name you have to draw a very realistic depiction of thing you wants to kill""

( basically in death note there is notebook called death note and if somebody writes someone's name in it the person would die of natural causes ,the show is just set around a prodigy who picks up the book and thinks he can save the world by killing criminals)


"" but there is another twist that you have to draw  the organism in an increasing depth and detail corresponding to their Intelligence, meaning the more intelligent the organism is the more detailed the drawing has to be""

""You go out and draw some rats some seagulls other Cockroaches and suddenly you encounter a cockroach who is living in your room""

"" no matter how many drawings you do or ask your genius artistic friend to draw the Cockroach, it never dies""

""You spend hours,days months to learn and draw perfect most realistic drawing of that specific cockroach that can be made""

"" you spend so much time with that Cockroach that you ever had with a living beings except your family""

""So it almost starts to feel like a family member""

"" until one day you finally succeed you had created the most realistic image of a living being there ever would be even more realistic than any humans you drew""

""The cockroach finally dies""

""What do you feel now? Essence of accomplishment? Sorrow because your pet like cockroach died?""

""Or greif because you have just killed the most intelligent,sentinal being that could ever exist on the planet"""

There is no comparison and I feel like it’s such an uneducated, cliche take that should absolutely be put to rest."

"Such thing as micro Cults? In its essence, 

Unquestioning faith: Members have extreme devotion to a person, object, or goal 

Charismatic leaders: Cults are often led by charismatic individuals 

Illegal and dangerous behaviors: Cults may involve illegal or dangerous activities 

Psychological and financial exploitation: Cults may exploit members financially or psychologically 

Mind control: Cults may use psychological manipulation to control members 

Anxious dependency: Cults may create a deep-seated dependency on the group and its leaders 

People get caught up on the spiritual, aspect.. but really anyone or a small group with these could be a cult. Especially if substances are involved.

Also when people leave they're usually shunned, no contact, guilted if they are, as in they've abandoned or wronged, get pressured to return, aggressively sometimes, or moral shaming.."

"""Why don't you check on Google"", an answer that doesn't make sense Hi! In all the subreddits related to questions or similar, you always find someone who says you should check on Google instead of asking. I think it doesn't make sense on many levels, one of them being the fact that you can find basically everything on engine searchs and probably most of the common topics amongs people have always been discussed thousands of time.

The point of a place like reddit is to discuss, and even a simple question (not ot ofc) can create an interesting discussion. What do you think?"

"What If All Fantasy Characters Became Real… But Just as Normal People? What if, one day, every single fantasy character from anime, cartoons, books, movies, and games just appeared in our world but with no powers, no magic, and no special abilities? Just regular people, walking among us.

Would we worship them as living legends, or would they just become a weird new social class?

Would they get special treatment because they used to be heroes and villains, or would people resent them for being ""fictional immigrants""?

Would Batman just be a rich guy who works out too much? Would Goku become a fitness coach? Would Zelda start a fashion brand?

How would society react to seeing famous villains walking around? Would we arrest them even though their crimes only happened in a fictional world? Would Hisoka or Joker be thrown in prison just because we know what they did in their stories?

Would villains try to recreate their past roles—even without powers? Would Light Yagami try to ""cleanse the world"" in new ways? Would Griffith feel guilty about everything he did, or would he still believe he was right?

Would superheroes try to be heroes again, despite just being normal?

Would some fantasy characters get bullied or rejected? Would people harass Mineta for being a perv? Would Shinji Ikari be forced into therapy?

Would the world even stay normal, or would this be the beginning of a new era, where reality and fiction are forever blurred?"
"Having sex is kind of awkward Having sex is great and all, but it feels so vulnerable to show someone my body and be so close with them. And I feel shy to even make sounds or have an expression. Sometimes I wish I can feel more comfortable to do it more casually but it’s just really awkward to me even if I want to do it. Perhaps that’s a blessing in disguise though so that I can be more selective with who I experience it with. Does anyone else feel that way? I feel like people either have no problem doing it casually or they are just selective but not awkward about it. "

There were definitely girls I knew when I was in middle school (not that many in high school, but tbh that might only be cause it wasn’t co-ed anyways) that I could probably have had a relationship with, or at the very least it seemed like there was a good chance of it not being fruitless. I mean one even had a crush on me at one point. It’s not necessarily that I was scared, it was a combination of not knowing where to start and more so… not having interest. But the thing is that I think the only reason I didn’t have interest was that I didn’t know that I was missing out. If I understood the value of having those experiences early I probably would have 

I think I just didn’t know what love was. Maybe it wasn’t properly taught or just not in me yet but I don’t know.

No. I need my partner drooling over me and only me tf.

Edit: Guys there’s a difference between a “crush” and just finding someone attractive. I’m not THAT insecure to be bothered by my partner finding another woman attractive😭 Being literally obsessed with the person is my issue. I’m not delulu guys…
Edit again: I’m not tryna be mean but some of y’all are illiterate 💀 just cause you think someone else is attractive doesn’t mean you have a crush on them. So I don’t think it’s bad to find others ATTRACTIVE in a relationship cause that’s just shallow.

Camping showers All during my childhood i have gone on occasional camping trips with my grandparents in their RV. I came to think about a feeling i always felt going to the public showers on a campsite. I live in sweden so most camping showers are decently maintained. Every night that i would walk over to take a shower i would get this cozy feeling like damn its hard to explain but the feeling of walking like 50 meters or so to the showers during the summer nights was so cozy and the feeling of just being in the shower and its not because the public showers were high quality but damn

We're often reading text that takes forever to get to the point, does not give concise information, and is probably someone's thesis or research paper. It feels like these papers are being used as the standard for how we should write, and in turn the schools churn out more papers which eventually get used as school material. So we're forced to pad out our own papers to fit the view of the academics who also grew up on padded out papers and so padded out papers have become the norm and writing concise text is considered unprofessional and bad form.

What is your useful but weird skill? Mine is i can yawn without making a face or a noise. It's super handy during boring conversations. 
"You know when people say, ""your experience is a life lesson"" it only means , it means it's only gonna get worse from here I was just thinking, it's been more than six months that I broke up with a guy who lied and cheated. It was my mistake to believe him, he was so convincing. Anyway, clearly I am very dumb because the guy before him, did the same thing to me. 
It's been tough trying to move on, the trauma has left me having to deal with the unanswered questions as to why this and that happened. All that crap is going on in my head, and then I realised, 
People tell you,  ""be glad that it's over, it's a lesson for you, now you know how to spot the red flags, how to identify a narcissist"" but the lessons I learnt before did not equip me to handle a situation like this recent one, life just upgrades it's level of difficulty, like a videogame, and now I know, life is always gonna get worse , and I'm gonna meet bad people with worse intentions or why would I encounter people with such personalities. It's like  practicing math, but you getting other kinds of problems in an exam which you've never been taught before, so you learn new techniques again, n it goes on.. 

When it comes to relationships, 
Some live life on easy mode
Others ,like me, cannot come down to easy mode anymore , I've experienced so many levels of betrayal and abandonment, I feel like I'm wearing level 8 armour covering my wounds and scars so as to not get hurt anymore"

"Am I being insecure or just realizing people are mean… I hate when a random group of friends look at each other with no response after you say something, or after they look at you, or in whatever situation. Like do you have a problem with me? It’s not like I CANT take it personally because they’re literally looking at me and judging😭
Like today in my college public health class I sat down at a random table (the table arrangements are different every class because it’s a shared room) and these two girls hesitantly walked up to me and my friends table. While staring at us like we aren’t supposed to exist on planet earth😒, then stared at each other and made that “why tf are they here” type of face towards each other. I HATEEE when girls do that shit like be fr. I HOPE YALL KNOW WHAT KIND OF LOOK IM TALKING ABOUT"
"Anyone else feel like they're living a lie? Kinda curious if anyone understands this. 
Basically I feel like I'm going through life in default. You graduate high school, you go to college, you get married, etc. but it just feels so boring. I see these people online traveling and partying and enjoying their life while they're young and I want that but I feel like it's impossible at this point in my life. I'm sick of living a boring life. I've told people that I want to move to a different state for a couple years and try new things but they say I'm crazy. (Note I don't wanna do this alone as I also have anxiety). I just don't feel like I'm being myself at this point. Does anyone else ever feel like this or understand what I'm talking about? "

"Random Thought #1 This thought popped up randomly during a fit of rage, is it true that we gain a perfect understanding of an event or phenomena, something intangible (like emotions) or a change in ourselves or our surroundings only when we are able to quantify it, i.e utilize something like numbers to bring it into our scope of logic. After pondering, i tried to put the idea to use, my first attempt was at measuring my fluency in a language I was aware of but was not proficient in. I drew up some crude parameters and started judging myself every time I spoke. AND surprisingly it helped. Recently I also realized that when I subconsciously graded anything, I saw myself looking rather objectively at it and when I take a conscious effort at the same, I become evern better at it. But my rubrics have no concrete backing such as a formula or established theory. What are your thoughts on the same ?"

Martin Luther king could still be alive today if he wasn’t assassinated. He was born January 15th 1929 meaning he’d be 96 years old today if he wasn’t assassinated and he was healthy enough to make it that far in life. He could have witnessed an African American presidency(Obama) and how far the world has come when it comes to racial equality post 1960’s. Just a cool random thought.

"Do anyone have cute aggression? Meaning = When you are overwhelmed by how cute something is, your brain tries to regulate emotion by balancing this overwhelmingly positive emotion with a negative response, which makes you want to squeeze or bite it. The main theory is that it's an emotion regulator.

"social media good or bad? I am old enough to remember life without constantly being in my phone or having it around. I do like the convenience of my phone and everuthing it brings me. (And I do love reddit)

However, the times before facebook, instagram and all that crap were definitely hapier times. It's really fumny that all these services supposedely bring people together. In a certain sense they do yes. But this is no positive sum game. There is something you give up and it is your privacy, mental well being and happiness. 

Fuck progress, I want to go in a village, with my wife and kids, have a normal job and be happy"

"What motivates me This might sound a little corny but gravity motivates me.

 I don't know if you guys remember that guy Felix Baumgartner who jumped from the stratosphere for Red Bull and whenever I'm jumping into a new thing I picture what he was going through when he jumped. Gravity is powerful constant and there's not much you can do about it but go with the flow. As you know it's just going to literally propel you to your destination. Therefore I can say as long as gravity exists I have motivation.

"Most people forget so many things as life goes on, it’s almost as if we are somewhat delusional. Our brains can only hold so many memories. We forget people we’ve met, worked with, had heart to hearts with, dated. We forget places we’ve been, movies we’ve seen, beliefs we once held. When something is out of sight for long enough, it is often out of mind eventually. When I find myself scrolling through old photos or screenshots, I sometimes cringe with embarrassment at things I’ve done or said but have since forgotten. Some pictures remind me of whole chapters of my life I’ve tucked away deep into the recesses of my mind, and often bring me to tears with nostalgia, sadness or even guilt because my mind has taken them for granted and put them on a back-burner while my still hearts aches for them. Some things hold so much weight that they eclipse other elements, which are also impactful but remain in our periphery until we are reminded and they come back into focus.

TLDR: If we are the sum of our experiences, but so many are forgotten, are we really who we “think” we are? "
"I think there’s a corporate of scammers I was thinking earlier today at work bc I got 5 different calls on the work phone from 5 different people but all from the same company, different voices but all claimed to be from…… how do u think they recruit these people?

"Would you shorten your life by a year, to be instantly fluent in another language? Learning languages takes a long time (not sure of the validity of some YouTubers who claim to learn a language in a day or a week), and many times, it can be boring. So, as the question asks, would you trade the last year of your life, to instantly be fluent in another language of your choice right now?

As for me, no. I like the journey of learning languages and laughing as I make mistakes. I do admit I would like to speak my family's native language, but one day I may be fluent.

Edit: Oh, yeah. Another reason why I said no is because I like living as much as I can, LOL."

"Adding to the previous thought regarding phone scammers, I think we should normalize taking rage out them verbally. No, really.  Maybe they’ll stop if we save up all the “go f*** yourselves” that we say in our heads all week and redirect them toward the people who are such shit people that they spend their time calling other human beings with the intent to lie, cheat and steal from them.  

Rage rooms would cease to exist and therapy sessions would go way down.

"Middle Age reasoning I think somehow many people have a notion that we all live to 100 years old. Maybe because it's a nice solid number and the brain sets a subjective range of time.

But if you look at life expectancy hovering aroun 84 years old for a male on one end of the spectrum in one country, while in other countries the life expectancy is around 54 years old.

So in reality middle age is between 35-45 give or take."

I really want a chicken picatta 🤔 It is the pe lrfect flavor and texture profile right now. The savory chicken and chicken-infused sauce. The tender chicken covered in the flour-dredged and seared sides that have recently softened and uptaken the sauce. The creamy sauce with the briney capers and everything topped off with lemon. Damn I have none of the ingredients. 😑 Think it can be very good with some mushrooms and herbs as well. This reminds me of chicken Marsala as well. 🤔

I know it's just couple of compliments but as someone who has anxiety-depressive disorder and was bullied all my life I finally got my main character moment. I hope  16 year old me got to feel it too, I hope everyone gets to experience it as least once in life, even if it is for just few minutes 🤍"

"First love never fades… or does it just change? They say that first love stays with you forever. Not because you still live it, not because you still love the same way, but because it was the first. The first wild heartbeat, the first longing that kept you up at night, the first lesson about how beautiful and chaotic the soul can be when it gives itself away.

Maybe you're not the same person anymore. Maybe you've loved and been loved many times since, in deeper, more mature ways. But somewhere, in a quiet corner of your memories, that feeling remains, not as a wound, not as a regret, but as proof that you were there, that you felt, that you were alive.

And maybe that's why first love never really disappears. It changes. It settles quietly in the past, but it never truly leaves.

What’s your opinion?

I’m not afraid of eye contact and I’ll look at them in the eyes from time to time but I legit cannot always hear what words ppl say or I’ll mix their words up with others so I fixate on their mouth sometimes…

"All of sudden, I've just realized that I LOVE printing on a printer Just imagine: after days of suffering, sleepless nights, you finally end your project you put 99% of your soul into. In the program you worked (LibreOffice in my case) you press the button with a printer on it. Then, after you check everything is fine, you press that ""Print"" button (on Windows, it glows blue). And it begins! Your printer starts to make noises, even though they can be loud, they're not annoying at all. Sometimes I even like it. And after seconds, it takes the first piece of paper. This paper is inside of the printer. It makes this way to have the part of your project on itself. Just a few seconds - and you get the same piece of paper back, but now with the first page of the project. Then, the printer eats the second piece of paper and gives it back with the content. Then the third, fourth, fifth… finally, you can feel all the work you've been doing all last time in your hands. Oh, and of course, the paper is warm. Just the exact temperature so you can feel the best feelings in the world when you touch the pieces. But unfortunately, it becomes the room temperature too fast, and you stop feeling emotions again.

"How are babies capable of learning so much? Alr i might just be really dumb but as new born babies we just look around at people doing random gestures and saying 'gibberish' and over a period of 2-3 years we just normally start understanding what everything means with no base at all, and learn it as a language?!

This same question in the title gets me confused in all aspects, but communication is what that keeps me thinking the most. Because when were older with developed brains, at what extent can we learn a language just by listening to it for a couple of years? I think only a little more than the basics at most. And I mean only listening to convos, cause have you seen parents go around and hold a milk carton in front of their baby and teaching what its called? lol no. And why are we in general less capable of doing this at this later stage of life when we aren't small kids?"
