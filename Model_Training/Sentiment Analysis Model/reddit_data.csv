"Changes to r/RandomThoughts are coming Hey friends, Just informing all of you that we're in the process of changing some rules to make them easier to understand. Please be on the lookout for that over the coming days. If you have any ideas that you think should be implemented please let us know in the comments here."
Pretend it's Monday...I didn't lie üòÖ We have plans in place to begin using r/randomquestions (also owned by us) to restore this subreddit to specifically just random thoughts. The questions flair we have here was only supposed to be temporary and was never supposed to be permanent in any capacity. As of right now you are welcome to continue posting your questions here but that may change in the near future. Any questions posted here after we remove the questions flair will be removed and you will be redirected to r/randomquestions.

"I love seeing myself through a photographers eyes‚Ä¶ I did a photoshoot a while back, and each photo I didn‚Äôt like I was hypercritical of. The ones I liked were heavily staged from what I‚Äôve been doing in photos since I was probably 13 (I‚Äôm 27) now. 

The photographer just sent me all the photos. And sent me ones by hand that he loved, describing why he liked them. I remember they were when I was more relaxed or not quite paying attention. All I saw was: ‚Äúwhy is my nose that big? My smile is terrible. Am I that fat from that angle?‚Äù And other typical thoughts. But he went through what he liked.

And honestly, I just can‚Äôt hate the photos anymore. It was sweet to hear and why. "

In the summer I understand that I can be a burden since I need shadow breaks and coolness rather often to not faint and I understand that not many would put up with this but like- are there people that would or do you guys think it's too much of a mental strain"

"Who is asking for all this AI? Recently, I noticed thousands of companies rushing to use AI products, but who is using it? How is it helpful? Could anyone provide some insight here as I think it distorts news, writing, and art. I'm confused as to why people are jumping on this bandwagon when all of the current tech we have is fine except for the occasional crash. I also understand that people with disabilities may benefit from AI voice recognition, but is there really anything else that AI helps with?"
I wonder what all the hollerers and yellers who start popping up in my crappy neighborhood when the tempts rise Do with all the racket during the cold months.

How to shop in the women‚Äôs section with more confidence? I‚Äôm a straight male and I‚Äôve stared this new way of life.

I‚Äôm not exactly proud of it, but that‚Äôs how I am, and at 23-years-old I don‚Äôt think my personality can change.

"I can't see the stars It's so weird. I live on a college campus. Everyone can see the stars but me so it's not like there's too much light and no one can.

I was stargazing with a friend a couple years ago. I saw maybe two tiny dots of light, but they saw way more. Once while I was walking at night with another friend I acknowledged that the night sky didn't have stars. He looked at me like I had two heads. He said there were a lot of stars in the sky, but I saw none.

I still don't see stars in the sky. I've seen them at home, but not here at college. Everyone else sees the stars here and I don't. It's so bizarre."

"Why is free thinking soo opposed? No one wants unbiased opinions, there‚Äôs too many sheep Iknow i sound like the guy that everyone disagrees with and im butt hurt but that‚Äôs not the case lol im being honestly genuine here‚Ä¶.seems like ppl just want to fall in line with whatever the most common status quo is instead of approaching the subject at hand from all different points of view instead of shunning the matter due to personal disinterest, unpopularity, subconscious-associations, fear-of-judgement etc. 

I know for a certainty that many dislike or fear the idea of free thought unbiased opinions because of the future ramifications for what it could signify for what they believe reality to be. 

Yup thats what it is i answered my own question through my randomness of ongoing rambling in my head.

‚ÄúPeople dislike things that destroy reality as they know it/how they make sense of things big or small. They don‚Äôt hate it for the inherent qualities but for what it could signify.

"I wonder how many people have VPNs, because now is the time to get one. If we get media blackouts, access to regular sources of information may be geo-blocked.

VPN secures your privacy/location, jumps over those geo-blocks, and keeps you connected.

I'd pick an EU one. Have been using VPNExpress myself for years and it works well, but there's lots of choices.

Better to have it and not need it, than to need it and not have it."
"Seeking hope Our dog Willow stopped eating Friday and started throwing up around the same time but just a little so we thought ahead might be sick because we‚Äôve been sick for like 3 weeks and she‚Äôs seemed a little off since we got sick and also around that time she got her rabies vaccination.

She had also taken her dose of amoxicillin and 2 anti nausea pills last night and today. She is now at a ICU with fluids, electrolytes and IV antibiotics for at least till tomorrow to see if she is improving. Has anyone gone through this and has their baby gotten any better? Thanks ..looking for hope "

"Instead of assuming common sense, we should assume common ignorance. Instead of assuming everyone just should know something, it makes more sense to assume common ignorance. Not in a condescending way either, but in a way that helps with patience, better communication, and less unnecessary frustration.

"Why don't we have Translation Clubs in schools and universities so that they can build experience being translators and practice different languages? This can be incorporated into language specific clubs like French Clubs to give them things to do. A list of.. (continued in post) ...most wanted books to be translated can be added with a thumbs up rating to see which ones really are wanted more. Maybe, these clubs can be paid per book they translate (as long as they don't use AI services). These can include children's books to even novel series. This can even introduce new ideas to different parts of the world that could help with democracy or human rights. Of course, we'd have to message the author(es(ses) if they want their book translated. (Sorry had to repost for a grammar fix)"

"Why do they call different people races but different animals coats colourings Pugs, collies are different species. A blue or brindle great dane is not a different species, they are different outer colour.. you don't call a brindle a different species than a blue great dane.. race doesn't exist, you can track it genetically, but you likely could also track coat colour genetically, or which region they were from if you got more in depth with that breed genome.. but no one wants to spend 15 years decoding each dog genome unless they were done or very close to finishing human for research purposes.. but by then we'll likely be on mars.

Neanderthal, denisovans, homosapians.. different species, Spanish, Indian, different colouring.. 

Brindle, blue, is not a race. Neither is anything else. You're either a person, or you don't exist anymore.. from being extinct. If you exist, you're a person.. great, but don't get caught up on semantics when you could dumb it down to something similar when it's arbitrarily pointing to Species.. than colouring.. fucking stupid, I am of the curly hair race, how bout you? Sounds stupid too.. but you could probably track where that specific kind of curly mainly populated to, so Hey why not. Same hair, now the same race.. now we can figure that out. And how to argue about that"

"Have I fallen for a scam! Sometimes, I look at those people who don‚Äôt take life seriously, barely studying, staying up all night, sleeping half the day, and just‚Ä¶ existing. And you know what? They seem so much happier than the ones grinding non-stop to build a career, chase dreams, and ""secure a future"" (which, apparently, is me).

And then I wonder‚Ä¶ was choosing ambition a mistake? Maybe life‚Äôs secret cheat code is not having goals. Imagine the peace of mind! No stress, no deadlines, just pure, blissful ignorance. Meanwhile, here I am, overworked, underslept, and probably aging faster than I should.

Honestly? I lowkey envy the carefree ones. They might not have a five-year plan, but at least they have eight hours of sleep.

"What is the purpose of good looks? 
I am considered fairly attractive by most people and I have seen it to be of effect in many places. For eg., people letting me off for being clumsy or being receptive towards me or just generously helping me with things which I can do myself. 
Some ~12 years ago, I posted a simple picture which gained a LOT of likes and comments in just 2 days. This gave me an idea that I could gain a lot if i pursued on that path. By a lot I mean.. followers, influence and then money.. the deal.

In the recent times, I have seen many girls profit off their good looks in many ways. This also includes landing a rich guy, influencing people to have their way or making big money if they are willing to strip for the camera, what not.

I have stirred clear of this. I am not on any social media, I don‚Äôt look for guys with money, I have been in the social service line since I graduated and I don‚Äôt let myself get off unfairly for something I have done wrong even if I see the person in front of me is willing to.

Recently my parent who has a clothing line wants to profit off my looks and wants me to pose and talk pleasingly and make short videos to pull in business. I do not want to do this.

This has got me to wonder, what good are looks for if you don‚Äôt want to use it to manipulate or profit off of in any way?"
"My Two Contradicting Minds I often experience two conflicting thoughts in my head one part of me supports an idea while another part disagrees. After doing some research, I learned that this feeling is called **cognitive dissonance**. This theory was introduced by Leon Festinger in 1957 and explains the mental discomfort we feel when our beliefs or actions conflict.

We all face situations like this. For example, we value loyalty and honesty, yet sometimes we may not tell the complete truth. Or we know eating junk food isn‚Äôt healthy, but many of us still do it. Often, we even defend our own ideas or those of people we care about, even when we might be wrong.

So, how can we deal with this inner conflict? Based on my own experience, I believe that experiencing cognitive dissonance is a natural part of life it comes and goes, just like birth and death. Instead of trying to avoid it (which can actually cause more stress), we should learn to work with it. It can offer a fresh perspective and challenge our old beliefs, which is a chance to grow and learn.

some simple steps that have helped me:

1. **Self-Reflection:** Take time to think about your thoughts and feelings. Understanding why you feel conflicted is a good first step.
2. **Clarify Your Emotions:** Organize your thoughts and try to understand what exactly is bothering you.
3. **Meditation:** This can help calm your mind and provide a clearer perspective.

I hope you find these ideas helpful!

"what did you do when you get your fist paycheck ? I remember why first paycheck, it was the first time i got some money, some good money for my own.

Of course, before splurging, i did put aside rent money and bills, but i had some money left and i really wanted to buy something nice and treat myself.

So i went to the mall, saw a movie, had some burger king, got a brand new ps3 game and bought me a nice watch. I think the brand new leather watch with the big thick strap was my first ever splurge, i always loved seeing actors on tv wearing that bulky watch with the thick leather strap so it was the first thing i ever did with my own money, but that watch and it served me well for many years.

Also, i got a chicken whopped meal from burger king, i know this will sound crazy, but it was the best burger i ever had, because it was the first meal i paid for it with my own money, i swear until this day, i can still remember how delicious it was, just knowing i earned that food.

So how about you ?"

"Most people walk around like puppets. Most people in western culture walk around like puppet on a string, , reacting and complaining .

Getting offended, exploding in anger because someone said something or did something 

They let other control their emotions like a remote control. 

Weak slavery of the mind. 

EVERYTHING YOU FEEL, anger, frustration, irritation, offense, is a choice and most people don't even realize it. They go through life reacting like puppets thinking EMOTIONS happen TO THEM but that's the greatest lie that's ever been sold. 

No one forces anger into your mind or injects frustration into your veins 

YOU DO IT. YOU ALLOW IT. YOU PARTICIPATE IN IT AND THAT MEANS YOU CAN STOP IT

Most people live in a prison of their own making, blaming their emotions on the outside world. 

""She disrespected me "" "" they shouldn't have said that"".WEAK THINKING. SMALL THINKING. 

A mindset of a person that will never be free because the moment you say someone else made you angry, you are admitting they control you, literally. You're admitting your emotions are of that of a puppet and the world holds the strings and that's simply pathetic because the truth is YOU HOLD THE STRINGS

AND YOU ALWAYS WILL"

"Glinda is the villain of the Wizard of Oz Based purely on MGM‚Äôs The Wizard of Oz, I have concluded that Glinda is the true villain of the movie, not the Wicked Witch of the West.

The facts:

1. Glinda magically took the ruby slippers from the Wicked Witch of the East and put them on Dorothy, this unprepared girl, making Dorothy a target. 

2. Doesn‚Äôt tell Dorothy the slippers could send her home ‚Äúbecause you wouldn‚Äôt have believed me.‚Äù This is ridiculous, Dorothy was told they had power, shocking the Wicked Witch of the West when she tried to take them.

3. She sends Dorothy to the Emerald City by foot, putting her in danger.

4. The only time she helps Dorothy is when she‚Äôs put to sleep by the poppies. 

Now, what occurs as a result of the events of the movie?

1. The Wicked Witches of the East and Wesr are killed.

2. The Wizard returns back to Kansas from Oz.

Who benefits from that? I say Glinda does. She has all of her competition removed, leaving her free to take over Oz herself.

I suspect she even talked the Wizard into cooperating with her in the first place.

Conjecture: 

Glinda wanted more power. She needs threats to that power removed. She comes up with a plan: bring a patsy from our world to Oz and get her to do the dirty work.

She directs Dorothy‚Äôs house to land on WWE, to start the chain of events. She knows Dorothy can‚Äôt do it on her own and makes sure she has backup.

She keeps an eye on things to make sure Dorothy gets to the Emerald City so the Wizard can send her to kill WWW.

Then while they are at WWW‚Äôs castle, Dorothy accidentally spills water on WWW, killing her‚Ä¶ but why would WWW even have water in her castle at all? I suspect Glinda planted it there. 

So the wicked witches are dead, the Wizard leaves Oz, Dorothy is sent home, and there‚Äôs a power vacuum left in Oz for Glinda to fill. 

By the way, the whole ‚Äúit was just a dream‚Äù thing was just Glinda messing with Dorothy‚Äôs mind‚Ä¶ and probably had the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion resemble the farm hands‚Ä¶ and maybe made Gulch look like the witch. 

And the ruby slippers probably stayed in Oz, too, so Glinda could gain their power."

Watching these people get engaged, buy houses, publish their first books (something I dream of doing) is making 19-year-old me think that I'm late at life.

"Undercover Boss How was the ‚ÄúUndercover Boss‚Äù  show on for 15 yrs or whatever it was?. 

And your telling me that one day you‚Äôre working at a fast food place and you hear that a new employee is coming in but for only about two weeks and then he shows up and you know immediately it‚Äôs the UB because he has the WORST disguise on ever. 

Then 5 min into his shift he suddenly doesn‚Äôt know how to make the french fries like they should be made (even though he‚Äôs the one that invented them) so he then gets berated by the 20 yr old mgr who smells like weed and is getting jacked up on energy drinks, all shift. 

   Then lunch comes around and him and the one other employee are just randomly eating lunch in the break room talking about nothing.  Then he comes out with the same thing ‚Äúso Tell me about your family?‚Äù And guess what? The 26 yo girl tells how she beat cancer at 7yr old but at 12 the family house burnt down because they had to heat their home by leaving the burners on the stove burning all night long.  So she had to live on the streets and do things she did not want to do to survive after that for a year. Finally she says she got her GED and wants to be a nurse but just in the last yr her mother was paralyzed after getting hit by a car and the motorized wheelchair the insurance bought her caught on fire and they can‚Äôt afford to pay for another one. So now mom lays in bed and somehow has started huffing paint but lies about it even though she has a gold paint ring around her nose mouth every night And if that‚Äôs not enough, the employee still has no idea who her dad is and mom is getting all whacked out on huffing paint when the girl asks get serious with her and says she really wants to know who her dad is mom just yells ‚Äúget out of my room. You disappoint me!‚Äù

And we all know the end he ends up getting them a new home mom new wheelchair and gets her off huffing all that paint by sending her to the $10,000 a week passages of Malibu recovery program. And the employee is given $100,000 in cash a new house and has a scholarship at some technical college named after her. The saddest part is you look her up to see where she is now and she is homeless again because Covid happened and her mom and her got so bored they started huffing paint and duster constantly that they both now are whacked out of their mind. She now spends her days picking up smoked cigarette butts off the highway median and putting them in her pocket to smoke later.  Who knows where mom is and she‚Äôs stopped asking about who her dad is or was. Because through all her pain, she is finally realized that she is a disappointment yet last heard from her she vowed to get back on track. Whatever that means!!!!

"Being Very Attractive Comes with a Price ‚Äì Does Anyone Else Feel This Way? **Who This Question Is For**

This isn‚Äôt for people who get called cute or attractive by their partners or friends. I‚Äôm talking to those who experience a different level of attractiveness‚Äîthe kind where:

	‚Ä¢	Strangers randomly stop you just to say you look good, then walk away.


	‚Ä¢	You can predict when a group of the opposite sex will make a commotion when you walk by.


	‚Ä¢	You get anxiety from all the staring, to the point where it makes you not want to go outside.


	‚Ä¢	People assume you‚Äôre arrogant just because of how you look.

	‚Ä¢	At the gym, you can‚Äôt just work out‚Äîsomeone will stare or try to start a conversation.

	‚Ä¢	At work, coworkers treat you differently, 
either extra nice or weirdly standoffish.

	‚Ä¢	Some people straight-up look at you like an object for their pleasure, not a person with thoughts and boundaries.

**The Sexual Objectification Problem**

This one really bothers me. I come from a race/ethnic group of men who I‚Äôve found are very sexually objectified by women.

When I was younger, I thought that was cool‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt fully understand what was happening. But now, at 32, I‚Äôve gotten much wiser, and I see the implications of it.

It REALLY bothers me when I catch women looking at me like I‚Äôm just a walking dildo‚Äîlike I exist purely for their sexual fantasies and should be grateful for their attention.

For women, I imagine this is like when certain men see them as nothing more than a sex doll‚Äîjust something to use and discard, with no real interest in who they are as a person. That‚Äôs exactly how it feels, and it‚Äôs dehumanizing.

**The Harsh Reality **

While it‚Äôs flattering (and I‚Äôd never trade places with an ugly person in a million years), it‚Äôs bothersome knowing that people treat you well only because they find you attractive.

Because deep down, you know:
	‚Ä¢	If you were born ugly, people would treat you completely differently‚Äîsometimes even cruelly.

	‚Ä¢	If you ever got into a freak accident that ruined your face, your life would completely change.

	‚Ä¢	You‚Äôd be banned from ever sleeping with beautiful people again, and if you‚Äôre lucky, some equally unattractive person might take you in.

**I really wish the world wasn‚Äôt like this.**

Yes, Being Attractive Has Benefits‚ÄîBut There‚Äôs a Price to Pay

I‚Äôm not denying the advantages of being attractive. I‚Äôm obviously glad that women are attracted to me and that I‚Äôm not forced to be an incel over something I can‚Äôt control.

But people don‚Äôt talk about the downsides enough:
	‚Ä¢	You can never just blend in.

	‚Ä¢	There‚Äôs always SOME stranger who wants to interact with you, even when you just want to be left alone. And it happens frequently.

	‚Ä¢	People feel entitled to your time. They assume you should be friendly 24/7.

	‚Ä¢	Rejecting someone feels extra uncomfortable because they assume you‚Äôre out of their league.

	‚Ä¢	Random people, sometimes complete strangers, feel the need to touch you‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs your arm, hair, or back.

	‚Ä¢	And the worst one‚Äîpeople sexualizing you in a way that strips you of your humanity.

My company refused to provide work from home and asked me to take leave without pay if my paid leaves are exhausted. I didn‚Äôt argue as it was company policy.

Few days later, there was some urgent work which required my help and they not only allowed me to work from home, they sent my work laptop home with the support staff. (Yes we left work laptop in office. Company policy)

"Why do kids still use school books instead of an E reader? I know things vary a bit depending on area/region, but in a lot of areas kids are still carrying school books to school in a backpack. Some schools still allow backpacks. Some require them to be clear. Others vary. But it seems that even though a lot of kids have Chromebook or laptops, there‚Äôs still a lot of places that they have textbooks as well.

It‚Äôs 2025. Why in the world do schools not simply have textbooks downloaded onto an E reader or tablet, where the kids just carry that? Was this a huge missed opportunity by Amazon or some other company, where years ago they could‚Äôve created a school E reader And heavily pushed it?

I mean by college they would still find a way to make profits from books and just charge a ton of money for the download, so it‚Äôs not like college kids would save a lot of money. But younger kids in primary schools could save their backs and it would be a lot safer than carrying around pounds of books and supplies."

"Commercials I don‚Äôt trust commercials. The advertisements are made to motivate you and get you to buy things and they talk about how amazing the products are.The product could be terrible and possibly harmful but they‚Äôll say it‚Äôs great. Of course the commercials are biased because it‚Äôs their product (duh) so they wouldn‚Äôt tell us and they‚Äôd lie to us about it just to make a sale. I don‚Äôt trust the commercials where they bring in actors, celebrities or athletes either bc of course they‚Äôre being paid to say what the company wants and they wouldn‚Äôt say anything negative about whatever they‚Äôre selling. I have a tendency to trust products from people on social media platforms that aren‚Äôt being sponsored or payed to promote them.

"I love the way strangers bond over the randomest of things I‚Äôve been going to the gym for the past 5 months and the first few weeks, I was just doing my workout and leaving.

Then, it was random compliments from them on my form or improvements in body, or a PR. Now, I‚Äôm friends with two or three people and on smiling terms with half the gym in my time slot. 

That got me thinking, I never knew these people beforehand. I wouldn‚Äôt have given them the time of the day if we passed each other by outside.

"Ever wondered if all the meat you ever ate was the kind of meat you thought it was? I'm no vegetarian, and I probably never will be, but sometimes certain things I've eaten and certain places I've eaten at sort of haunt me a little bit. Not necessarily in an extreme way that keeps me up at night or anything, but definitely in a way that made me stop eating certain dishes at certain restaurants.

For example, one time my friend introdced me to this new chicken chain that sold these crazy huge drumsticks. I'm talkin' turkey leg sized chicken drumsticks. They didnt taste weird or anything, but the next time I went to that restaurant and every time I've been since that first time, the wings and drumsticks have all been normal sized and no matter where I look online in reviews or pictures or advertisements for this chain - nobody else ever mentions those giant, turkey leg sized drumsticks...

Had a similar experience at another place, known for their spicy chicken. The first time I went there it tasted great, but then this one time I ordered from the same place on DoorDash and it just tasted all wrong. The flavor was off, the consistency was off, and even the smell was kinda strange. Like nothing I've ever eaten before. It was all rubbery and tasted kinda fishy and it smelled like piss. Threw it away after the first bite.

Anyone else ever have an experience like that with food, where it was randomly way bigger out of nowhere, or the taste/smell/texture of the food was just wrong or off somehow?"

Most of the time we pull them out of our pocket, unlock it, and open an app, it‚Äôs not even a conscious decision. One thing I think is really sad is how so many kids are growing up and literally having their brain developed around technology 24/7. It‚Äôs not healthy, it‚Äôs artificial.

"Economic system. Any economists and the like here? What if the govt had a system set up akin to Share. You voluntarily sign a contract to work in public service with a graduated benefit upon completion of time or quantity. Areas of employment may narrow down to community needs.

These parts vary each and range from some percentage graded scale (not 100% at all for short contracts). Some also not available until longer contracts are completed. You of course can persue other methods of making a living as well. Depending on system viability, the final retirement benefits may or may not afford 100% for longer contracts."

I know there is actually a lot of very meaningful, symbolic art, but people seem to have forgotten that not every drawing wants to force a profound opinion onto the recipient. And as an artist myself I'm getting mad at artists who give these boastful, highbrow titles to their pieces, just so that they seem to hold more meaning.

"Ghosted/blocked my best friend 32 years old male for context* 

Last summer i completely ghosted and blocked my ""best"" friend. Actually he was my only friend. My only social life for years outside my relationship with my wife, occasionally i meet her friends (we live together so its inevitable). If that counts as a social life. 

I miss having someone to go to the cinema with , play pool or shoot some hoops with and talk about life and having deep insightful conversations with 

However I had to distance myself from this friend because he just changed completely 
And started constantly criticising me and even talking negatively about me behind my back and sharing stuff i had told him as secrets in private. Personal Sensitive stuff. 

So he used to be an introvert like me and I was his only friend as well. Difference is, he felt insecure about it. He started doing cocaine and became very social , he started going to groups and clubs and made many friends. I was happy for him for making friends but his whole personality changed. He became arrogant, insincere, hyper critical. 

He would sometimes manage to drag me along to meet some of these guys, these new friends. 

They were extremely immature.. talking about girls they had fucked etc.. i didn't resonate nor relate to their lifestyle and way of thinking at all .. he was Addicted to posting everything on social media and even posted a picture of me with him without my consent. He was also Addicted to online dating. So when I was with just him alone he was glued to his phone. 

Then little by little he started criticising me constantly for not being social, for not wanting to party and for not being normal as he put it

And when I found out he was talking shit about me behind my back several times 
I started seeing him more like a bully (someone who gets a kick out of talking down to others) than a friend. 

Sometimes I regret ghosting him because he regularly tries to contact me. He even called my mom ( we had been friends since we were in 3rd grade) i still didn't call him back 

And sometimes the no social life can be painful as a 32 year old guy 

But I dont think I should settle with fake friends just to have a social life. 

I think very likely he has no idea why i ghosted him. "

"There will never be a world without strife. The world, the universe itself is a shifting constant.

How we stop earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, and any other primal calamity. Can we do this without disrupting an action with cause without any consequence. Do you dream of the end of disease? Viruses, bacteria, protist, fungi, parasites of all kind share the same carbon chain we do. Their extinction is our end. How about cancer? Can we truly master biology? Because it takes mastering physics. We are not subject to the world, we are among it. Our empty towers are just rocks on top of each other. Our vehicles rely on the legacy of this planet for fuel. And between us we will never solve love, because that would make it duty instead. And the only way to let go is to embrace it."

All our life we have expected for this person to show up, maybe it's the influence of the movies we see in the childhood or maybe it's the hope in adulthood that someone will make us feel loved as we want to be 

And while no one can work through your traumas from childhood but your own self, as humans it's very natural to crave love from others even if you love your own self 

And while I get it it's very important to change the patterns not working for you as you might yourself be hindering yourself from getting that real love by staying in situations and repeating patterns that aren't good but what if there's no 'the one' 

What if no one comes along that cares about you as you care about them?

"Is this what the magic of coffee really is? So I'm a guy who usually doesn't get many headaches or mind forg when I wake up. If I'm up then I'm up and almost fully functioning in my job or whatever, sure a little groggy for a few mins but then I'm like Okie dokie can start work or whatever.

But today I felt tired and had a headache even after getting good night's sleep yesterday. And i really needed to work on something important so can't take a long break.

So I thought of trying out some coffee and kid you not, within 15-30 mins I'm back to working like normal. I mean is this what people feel everyday?

Obviously I've had coffee before, even when I'm in the office but it rarely does anything substantial for me in terms of productivity, it's only the taste that I like. 

So, this is just a dumb discovery for me of why other people need coffee, couldn't really understand what they meant by this. I just liked the taste similar to any other beverage."

"Every elementary should be language immersion Teaching kids a second language in high school is usually too late.  Do some learn, oh yes, and I'm infinitely jealous.  

But imagine your school district, where one school is German language immersion, one Spanish, one Chinese, one French, one Arabic and one Italian (as examples). 

Will these kids all learn to speak English?? You can bet they will.  In the US, there's really no getting away from it.   But these kids would all be speaking a second language with a good accent before they hit puberty. It's much easier to learn a language at an early age. 

I'm guessing somewhere in the US, there are individual schools that have done the heavy work and created a curriculum for each of my language examples, and surely others.  

Does anyone know of a school district that has done a few languages? "

"Such thing as micro Cults? In its essence, 

Unquestioning faith: Members have extreme devotion to a person, object, or goal 

Charismatic leaders: Cults are often led by charismatic individuals 

Illegal and dangerous behaviors: Cults may involve illegal or dangerous activities 

Psychological and financial exploitation: Cults may exploit members financially or psychologically 

Mind control: Cults may use psychological manipulation to control members 

Anxious dependency: Cults may create a deep-seated dependency on the group and its leaders 

People get caught up on the spiritual, aspect.. but really anyone or a small group with these could be a cult. Especially if substances are involved.

Also when people leave they're usually shunned, no contact, guilted if they are, as in they've abandoned or wronged, get pressured to return, aggressively sometimes, or moral shaming.."

"What If All Fantasy Characters Became Real‚Ä¶ But Just as Normal People? What if, one day, every single fantasy character from anime, cartoons, books, movies, and games just appeared in our world but with no powers, no magic, and no special abilities? Just regular people, walking among us.

Would we worship them as living legends, or would they just become a weird new social class?

Would they get special treatment because they used to be heroes and villains, or would people resent them for being ""fictional immigrants""?

Would Batman just be a rich guy who works out too much? Would Goku become a fitness coach? Would Zelda start a fashion brand?

How would society react to seeing famous villains walking around? Would we arrest them even though their crimes only happened in a fictional world? Would Hisoka or Joker be thrown in prison just because we know what they did in their stories?

Would villains try to recreate their past roles‚Äîeven without powers? Would Light Yagami try to ""cleanse the world"" in new ways? Would Griffith feel guilty about everything he did, or would he still believe he was right?

"My future husband thought I was a boy! He loves to tell the story about the first time he saw me (st a recovery meeting no less). He knows I hate it. I had really short hair w/no discernible style, was wearing no makeup and wore jeans and whatever. I didn't care abymy appearance because I didn't look for men there. He says I was stridently up the walk really aggressively, waving to and callyout a friend in my kinda deep voice. And he thought I was a boy for months!  Then he demonstrates it...and I die. 

Funny part is I thought he was""aging, jock,prick.  Due to the fact that he always just sat there with his shades on, legs Stu k out and a raging RBF.

It was my mistake to believe him, he was so convincing. Anyway, clearly I am very dumb because the guy before him, did the same thing to me. 
It's been tough trying to move on, the trauma has left me having to deal with the unanswered questions as to why this and that happened. All that crap is going on in my head, and then I realised, 
People tell you,  ""be glad that it's over, it's a lesson for you, now you know how to spot the red flags, how to identify a narcissist"" but the lessons I learnt before did not equip me to handle a situation like this recent one, life just upgrades it's level of difficulty, like a videogame, and now I know, life is always gonna get worse , and I'm gonna meet bad people with worse intentions or why would I encounter people with such personalities.

"Random Thought #1 This thought popped up randomly during a fit of rage, is it true that we gain a perfect understanding of an event or phenomena, something intangible (like emotions) or a change in ourselves or our surroundings only when we are able to quantify it, i.e utilize something like numbers to bring it into our scope of logic. After pondering, i tried to put the idea to use, my first attempt was at measuring my fluency in a language I was aware of but was not proficient in. I drew up some crude parameters and started judging myself every time I spoke. AND surprisingly it helped. Recently I also realized that when I subconsciously graded anything, I saw myself looking rather objectively at it and when I take a conscious effort at the same, I become evern better at it. But my rubrics have no concrete backing such as a formula or established theory. What are your thoughts on the same ?"

"Most people forget so many things as life goes on, it‚Äôs almost as if we are somewhat delusional. Our brains can only hold so many memories. We forget people we‚Äôve met, worked with, had heart to hearts with, dated. We forget places we‚Äôve been, movies we‚Äôve seen, beliefs we once held. When something is out of sight for long enough, it is often out of mind eventually. When I find myself scrolling through old photos or screenshots, I sometimes cringe with embarrassment at things I‚Äôve done or said but have since forgotten. Some pictures remind me of whole chapters of my life I‚Äôve tucked away deep into the recesses of my mind, and often bring me to tears with nostalgia, sadness or even guilt because my mind has taken them for granted and put them on a back-burner while my still hearts aches for them. Some things hold so much weight that they eclipse other elements, which are also impactful but remain in our periphery until we are reminded and they come back into focus.

TLDR: If we are the sum of our experiences, but so many are forgotten, are we really who we ‚Äúthink‚Äù we are? "

So, as the question asks, would you trade the last year of your life, to instantly be fluent in another language of your choice right now?

As for me, no. I like the journey of learning languages and laughing as I make mistakes. I do admit I would like to speak my family's native language, but one day I may be fluent.

"First love never fades‚Ä¶ or does it just change? They say that first love stays with you forever. Not because you still live it, not because you still love the same way, but because it was the first. The first wild heartbeat, the first longing that kept you up at night, the first lesson about how beautiful and chaotic the soul can be when it gives itself away.

Maybe you're not the same person anymore. Maybe you've loved and been loved many times since, in deeper, more mature ways. But somewhere, in a quiet corner of your memories, that feeling remains, not as a wound, not as a regret, but as proof that you were there, that you felt, that you were alive.

And maybe that's why first love never really disappears. It changes. It settles quietly in the past, but it never truly leaves.

"All of sudden, I've just realized that I LOVE printing on a printer Just imagine: after days of suffering, sleepless nights, you finally end your project you put 99% of your soul into. In the program you worked (LibreOffice in my case) you press the button with a printer on it. Then, after you check everything is fine, you press that ""Print"" button (on Windows, it glows blue). And it begins! Your printer starts to make noises, even though they can be loud, they're not annoying at all. Sometimes I even like it. And after seconds, it takes the first piece of paper. This paper is inside of the printer. It makes this way to have the part of your project on itself. Just a few seconds - and you get the same piece of paper back, but now with the first page of the project. Then, the printer eats the second piece of paper and gives it back with the content. Then the third, fourth, fifth‚Ä¶ finally, you can feel all the work you've been doing all last time in your hands. Oh, and of course, the paper is warm. Just the exact temperature so you can feel the best feelings in the world when you touch the pieces. But unfortunately, it becomes the room temperature too fast, and you stop feeling emotions again.

This same question in the title gets me confused in all aspects, but communication is what that keeps me thinking the most. Because when were older with developed brains, at what extent can we learn a language just by listening to it for a couple of years? I think only a little more than the basics at most.
