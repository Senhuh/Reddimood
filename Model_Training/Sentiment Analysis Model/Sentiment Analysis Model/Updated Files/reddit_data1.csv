Personally, the suffering in life makes me think that, if the choice is avaliable, I would go back and choose not to experience life at all in the first place."

‚úÖ Linky matches you with people who share them.
‚úÖ Chat and connect in a low-pressure way‚Äîno swiping, no dating vibes.

"What is the weirdest song you actually like ? I am not just asking about a weird song with a weird video, i mean a really weird song that might have a weird video that you actually love and enjoy listening to and resonates with you on many level.

I know many a good weird song, but none of them even comes close to SERPENT SKIRT - COCTEAU TWINS-  1996.

The song takes you to an almost dream like zen state of mind with a soothing melody, an angelic vocalization of words that while they don't seem to make sense, are actually very deep. Loved the song from 1996 until now and will forever live rent free in my head.

so what is your weird song of choice ?

p.s: i wonder how many of you who read this, actually went to youtube to check the song ? also, the first person to comment that their weirdest song is from RDJ (if you know, you know) then you are cool in my books."

"Housing crisis Could we levy an extra property tax on properties owned beyond that of your homestead and then use that revenue to provide a tax incentive to builders who sell new homes for under $250K. 

My thinking is the extra tax on properties people don‚Äôt really ‚Äúneed‚Äù but generate income off of might push those people into selling their houses and using the money elsewhere and on the flip side if we need more lower income housing options, make it so builders can earn more money making low income housing.

On the other hand, I know almost no one who is scared of turtles, yet they DO actually bite. And those bites can hurt quite a lot. I guess most people are a little cautious around snapping turtles, but most don't give other turtles a second thought."

"Are we naturally drawn to water bodies? As the title suggests, I just thought about this randomly while commuting to work. I take the seaside road to & from work, and I always see people just staring at the sea. 

I love the sea. I love to see the sunrise/ sunset, just going to the beach in the night and all that. And I‚Äôve seen a lot of people all around the world do so. At first my thought was, ‚Äúmaybe because we live in an island‚Äù. But people travel hundreds and thousands of kilometres just to see the waves and enjoy the beach or a lake, or rivers. 

Is it a genetic thing from thousands of years ago? Or we just love water because we were maybe born from it?  (I also know there are people who don‚Äôt like to be in water, but regardless)

Imagine 2 park benches. 1 is just a back and seat made of plain marble which totally fulfills the purpose of sitting. Another one is old style with a carved handle, a design element on the centre of the back, even the legs of the bench are full of design? Which one would you want? 

What do you people think we want? Do we want our things and material to be minimalistic to save resources and avoid wastage, because adding extra design elements does incur extra cost and material. 

Or do we want things around us to be full of design elements to give it a life? To have that extra taste?

"Do therapists need therapy themselves? Wouldn‚Äôt they require a clear bill of health to practice the profession, or none at all?

I‚Äôm just wondering if they have their own mental health issues, the advice they give may be based on biased opinions rather than logical reasoning with empathy. (I say logical because every situation is different, and different factors come into play, but still, it‚Äôs important to be empathetic to the patient.)

Or, if they get overwhelmed from back-to-back sessions with a variety of topics and heavy topics from patients, they can‚Äôt just cancel their day because they‚Äôre triggered or overstimulated.

But also, how would they know if they‚Äôre still in control at that point? Even those who have healed can relapse without warning. So, how does that work?

Even if the therapist regulates their own triggers, wouldn‚Äôt they be better suited to a different profession?

However, I‚Äôm also thinking about equal opportunity employment and not discriminating against them due to their health. "

I just hope that when I reach my twenties, it'll be one of the greatest experiences ever."

"anyone else does this for finding good music ? Hi, please keep in mind, i am oldschool, i don't use spotify or anything like this, i was actually deeply hurt when the music player was removed from android phones, but i found a way to put and listen to my mp3s on my phone.

But let us get down to the question, how do you guys find a song or songs you like ? personally, i get compilations, like now i have the ''BEST OF EDM JAN 2025'' on my phone and it is around 100 songs, i just put on my earpods and jog for an hour and listen to them and i make a mental note of the number of the track that i liked, for example, today i found out these new great songs :

\- KETTAMA - YOSEMITE - Track no25

\- Jazzy - No bad vibes - track no14

\- Boombox cartel -Heartbreak - track no 15

\- Cyril - Still into you - track no 16

\- Argy - Ritmo - Track no 35

yeah, i keep a mental note of the tracks, then when i come back to my office, i copy the tracks to a folder called ''My favorite tacks''.

Btw, i have to say, some of those tracks really blew my mind, Yosemite and Heartbreak now being some of my favorite tracks of this month, but Still into you has a great starting beat.

So tell me, how you find music you like ? "
"Entering into a relationship I‚Äôve come to know that there‚Äôs many people who enter into relationships while they‚Äôre either currently lonely or currently miserable believing if they had someone that person could make them happy.  I have made this mistake as well. 

Really and truly, people should enter into a relationship with someone while you‚Äôre single and you‚Äôre happy with your situation and happy with yourself that way you bring happiness to the table versus misery. 

Just a random thought.  "

Daily Motivation Life is beautiful. It sucks sometimes. It doesn‚Äôt care what you have going on. It doesn‚Äôt care if things are too much for you to handle. It happens regardless. But the beauty comes from those moments because you get the opportunity to grow as a person. You get the opportunity to figure out a solution. You get the opportunity to get better. So when life is bad. When life sucks. Just ask yourself one question. What can I learn from this?
"It‚Äôs okay to not care It's okay to not care about every little thing that happens in the world. It's impossible to fix every social problem üíØ and make everyone happy.

"Life spans Why does life have to be so random and unfair?? I've been seeing and hearing about sooo many people dying at young ages and it makes me wonder why do some people lose their lives so soon and some live to extremely old ages. It urks me a little bit because it makes me sad for all the people who didn't get a chance. When a young child dies from an illness and someone simultaneously celebrates their 105th birthday, like... what's up with that? Especially when people hit 110 and beyond, like really... It reminds me of billionaires hoarding the wealth while there are people starving to death. I know this obviously isn't the same thing as it isn't the fault of the elder people for lingering so long, but it just frustrates me. I wish several years could be sacrificed off of those unnecessarily long lives (sorry if that sounds harsh, but come on) and given to those who died far too young. If everyone could live to a median age of around 70-85, that would be nice. The balance of the universe feels off with these early deaths and supercentenarians co-existing. It gets my paranoid ass thinking and irritated. Rant over."

"I want to hug a bear I love bears so much, my favorite animal by far.

I know how dangerous they are and I don't care, I would do anything to get a bear hug, or just pet a bear. How can people not find them cute? 

If I had to die by anything it would be by a bear hug.


Edit: people seem to think I'm being serious, I know the dangers and how horrible many attacks are. Trust that you're never going to catch me ACTUALLY trying to befriend a bear. I just think they are very cute/interesting animals, and if I had it my way I'd be able to hug a bear without the imminent death part."

"The Oscars and the Grammys both suck for opposite reasons. I can't be the only one who thinks this.

The Oscars seem to be run by a bunch of ""cultured elites"" who hardly give credit to the actual good filmmaking of popular movies while always sucking off obscure dramas. I'm by no means saying those are bad and are in fact usually excellent films, but it just feels like the Oscars is biased in favor of underrated dramas that general audiences are"" too stupid to understand.""

Meanwhile, the Grammys tends to only acknowledge the super popular mainstream music and undervalues the lesser known music that can be so full of depth and artistic value, with the latter group being snubbed way too often just for the same generic recycled stuff to get all the limelight. 

I thought these award ceremonies were meant to acknowledge all good art regardless of its popularity. "

"Why is it always toilet paper? There's a tropical cyclone headed towards us (South East Queensland), due to make landfall sometime between Thursday afternoon and Friday morning.   It's a category 2, so we're expecting a lot of wind and rain. Which is a bad thing.

Fair enough, the stores have all sold out of bread and bottled water. People need those. But...... Why is there always a run on toilet paper? Even if the storm hits badly, it's likely to be over by the end of the weekend and, while there will be a lot of cleaning up to be done, we're still going to be able to get hold of grocery items. We're not out in the middle of the boonies and the entire rest of the country is not that far away. To get from the Gold Coast to an unaffected area is like 2.5 hours drive.

"Random - funny conversation with my Dad Backstory:  Back in college, I used to party pretty good.  Used to hook up quite a bit.

Dad joined the military early, never touched a drop of alcohol since having kids.  

When I graduated high school, he gave me 2 choices: military or college.  I picked college.  

He said I'd have to go at least 4 hours away then, so I could have fun and he wouldn't know about it.

I think he wanted me to live the life he never had.  Did everything for us.

Funny part:

I said, ""you know how you wake up and you have no clue where the f**k you are""?

""No, son.  Unfortunately, can't say that I do"".

""Oh, sorry"".

Probably should have thanked him, too.

I thought it was completely normal."

All you've gotta do is a sign a waiver, enter a lab, choose what features you want: swimsuit body, high intellect, clear skin, the works. You hate how clumsy you are? You can change that by the tap of a screen. Then enter a chamber, and now not only are you prettier or handsome (you look like a completely different person), you're more steady. You don't bump into walls easily in public, embarrassing yourself. As a matter of fact, you don't feel embarrassment at all. You don't feel all of the ugly emotions anymore. You're more motivated to do what you dream to do. Not from hard mental exercises and self-help books, but just by visiting a lab. You're happier. You no longer have to worry about depression, because you chose to delete all forms of sadness from your new profile. You no longer beat yourself up for mistakes you make because you make no mistakes. You are literally perfect. You have the perfect career, you have the money and looks you desire.  

If you could do this, would you do it?

Ah, But there is a catch... 

You would lose all of your current memories. You'll remember major people in your life, like maybe your parents or siblings, if they're close to you.... Very vaguely. If you're only close to your best friend, then you'll remember them. Also vaguely. But you won't remember any of the things you did with them. In your mind, they are merely a picture. Whereas everyone else in your life is completely forgotten... But you're rich and pretty and no longer insecure and unhappy.

"How many jobs have you had in your life and how old are you? Thinking about this a lot lately. I have had many different jobs and tried to learn as much as I could from each position. I did not like working early on. Something clicked my brain in my early 20's. 
I knew I wanted to buy certain things and the only way I ever had enough money was working every day I could. 

I've been working in some shape or form since I was 15. 
I worked for my grandparents utility company off and on from 15 to 29. We installed water, sewer, gas, power, and electrical lines of all shapes and sizes. Auger and directional bored under roads/interstates, railroads, and water ways. I learned to operate machinery, read plans, shoot grade, lay pipe on grade. We would sometimes have to fabricate our own tools lots of welding and designing on the fly. I quit a half dozen times but always went back.
I started off working ditches and running a shovel by the time I left for good I was bidding jobs and meeting with engineers and other job site supervisors. We worked mainly up and down the southeastern coast of the USA. From Florida to North Carolina but mostly in South Carolina.


I had a job briefly at a plywood plant on the general plant crew sweeping and restocking bathrooms, doing demolition, and so forth.
I enjoyed it, it was hot, but the hours and pay were decent. 6:30am to 2:30pm every day.

I had another job briefly at a counter top installer. It was fiberglass with some type of epoxy overlay. I did not care for the smell or the way they operated lots of wasted time driving hours for things to not fit properly or be totally unusable.

My mother had a cleaning and painting business so sometimes I helped paint apartment complexes with her. My step father did roofing and remodels I sometimes helped with that. Easiest way to get over my fear of heights was carrying shingles before we got a lift.

From 30 to 42 my wife and I managed a commercial property that we had businesses in. My part was a LAN center/arcade that opened in 2010 and closed when we sold the building in 2022. I enjoyed this the most. I repaired game systems, hosted large private events, tournaments for 50-100 players, BBQs, Midnight game launches, charity events, and 2 all night LANs a week from 2014 to 2020.

Every weekend we would charge a door fee from 8pm to 8am and order pizza, sell concessions, have video game scavenger hunts, tournaments, and give away prizes. 

During my 43 years on this planet I imagine I missed 10 or less days of work due to illness. I enjoyed seeing things I helped work on completed. These days I buy and sell video games and create things on 3D printers, CNC machines, and embroidery machines. Some of it is functional like shelving and some of it is artwork or toys like patches, coasters, gliders, and other items. I can also do most of my own home repairs, mechanic work, everything from changing oil and breaks to replacing parts as need.

So what types of job(s) have you had? Did you enjoy them, did you learn anything? Did you have a favorite? or a job you hated?"

For this is a whiff of eternal liberation.

And suddenly,
you are,
and you are not,
and in that,
you find freedom.

"Maturing Is Realizing That Jealous People Will Try to Make You Feel Jealous of Them One of the strangest shifts in adulthood is realizing that envy doesn‚Äôt always look like criticism‚Äîsometimes, it‚Äôs an attempt to make you feel like you‚Äôre the one falling behind. Instead of confronting their own insecurities, some people project them onto you through bragging, backhanded compliments, or carefully crafted narratives designed to plant doubt.

Nietzsche called this ressentiment‚Äîwhen people who feel powerless seek to undermine others rather than elevate themselves. Gore Vidal put it bluntly: ‚ÄúWhenever a friend succeeds, a little something in me dies.‚Äù Some don‚Äôt just envy success‚Äîthey feel personally diminished by it.

Once you see it for what it is, it loses its power over you. But it raises deeper questions: What  does that reveal about human nature? Is envy an unavoidable flaw, or can it be transformed into motivation? And the hardest question‚Äîhow often do we, even unconsciously, seek validation at someone else‚Äôs expense?"

"There are things this generation will never know because we don't know how many people have died with incredible, earth-shattering secrets. I was just thinking about how many things we just don't know.  It's kind of terrifying.  Here's what I wrote in my journal:

""There are secrets we humans will never come to know.  We will never understand.  Never question.  It's terrifying.  It's so crazy knowing that maybe 1000 years ago, someone might have found out about something amazing.  Incredible.  Life-altering.  And what if they died before they could tell anyone?  Humanity is so complex and layered, it would take millennia to dissect.  Everyone could be lying to us and we would never even know.  This could all be a hoax, carefully crafter to manipulate us.""

"Insta vs Reddit faceoff Faceoff between the commenters of each, imagined by AI.

A face-off between Instagram and Reddit commenters would be absolute chaos, like throwing a reality TV cast into a debate club. Here‚Äôs how it might go down:

Round 1: Opening Statements

Instagram Commenters: ""OMG slayyy üî•üî•üî• Best post ever üòç‚ú®üíñ #Goals #Blessed""

Reddit Commenters: ""Actually, if you examine the historical context of this image, you'll find‚Ä¶ [8-paragraph explanation with citations].""


Round 2: Debate Style

Instagram: Short, punchy, and emotionally charged. Lots of emojis, over-the-top praise, and instant negativity if they don‚Äôt like something.

Reddit: Either a highly intellectual deep dive or the most sarcastic, troll-laden reply you've ever seen. Sometimes both at once.


Round 3: Insults and Takedowns

Instagram: ""You‚Äôre just jealous. üíÖüôÑ""

Reddit: ""Your argument is fundamentally flawed because it lacks epistemological rigor. Also, your username is dumb.""


Round 4: Memes

Instagram: Aesthetic, viral meme formats with minimal words.

Reddit: Niche, highly specific memes requiring deep community knowledge to understand.


Round 5: Handling Criticism

Instagram: ""Haters gonna hate üòò‚ú®""

Reddit: ""Let me write you a 2,000-word essay on why you're wrong and cite five sources.""


Final Verdict

Instagram is all about vibes, clout, and reactions, while Reddit thrives on long-form arguments, sarcasm, and inside jokes. Put them in the same room, and it's a battle of emotion vs. logic, hype vs. cynicism, and fire emojis vs. TL;DRs.

The real winner? Probably the onlookers enjoying the absolute mess.

I want something that would break the gas in my stomach without releasing the farts 

It‚Äôs too embarrassing, the situation has been making me feel insecure and less feminine 

I am releasing gas mid intercourse 

Like I need help

I‚Äôm gassy and need something that would assist me without releasing the gas as farts "

"Has there ever been a movie or TV show based on a book or series of books that remained a near 100% faithful adaptation? I‚Äôm used to hearing readers complain about a show or movie straying from the book(s) that comprise the source material. 

I‚Äôm not a big reader, so am curious if a scene-by-scene adaptation is even possible and - if so - has it ever been done?"

"I want to get a job where I fire people for people I watch a lot of shows, and this stuff also happens in real life, where people are stressed out about having to fire someone, they put their sympathy for the people before the practicality of firing someone. 

Since I'm an outside observer, I don't have that issue. 

Here's some things to consider when thinking about who to fire.

1. Don't think about it in a personal way, if the person is your friend, that doesn't matter, if they break your friendship over this, then the friendship either wasn't that weak to begin with, or they don't have the emotional maturity to keep working at the company, they could be a liability, and thus firing them as the best course of action. 

I understand why they'd be upset, that's their way of making a living, but they're not the only one. 

2. Who cares if someone has a family, many people have a family, why should one person be given consideration over another? I know this sounds insensitive but my brother always complains about having to work on the holidays when he has a kid, but many people who work where he does have kids, so why should his situation matter more than theirs? 

3. Be objective about it, who is truly doing what's best for the company? Who is the most likely to continue to help the company? 

4. Don't beat yourself up too much, there are things in live that must be done, and doing them doesn't make you a bad person, if it wasn't you doing it, it would be someone else, and the burden would be placed on them. 

Any fallout that happens, you'll be able to get through it, just lay out the facts for the person you fired, if they argue with them, then that's their problem, not yours. 

5. Take this all with a grain of salt, I've never even have a job and probably have no idea what I'm talking about, but still, I'd like to take the stress off of people and fire people for them. "

"I was washing the dishes, and I thought it's been eons since I last read a book. But then I thought‚Äîsubtitles count as reading, right?! They say reading is the gold standard for vocabulary expansion. If you want to grow your vocabulary, it's better to read than to watch films and TV‚Äîand I agree. I used to love reading‚Äîbut don‚Äôt be fooled, I‚Äôm no bookworm. More like a book maggot? Book zygote? I don‚Äôt know. Stupid, corny jokes aside, I genuinely enjoyed reading‚ÄîI still kind of do, just too lazy to pick up a book lately. And I‚Äôve learned a lot of words from books, some of which I can even trace back to the exact one I found them in.

But here‚Äôs something I realized: I‚Äôve been learning just as many‚Äîif not more‚Äîwords and concepts from films, series, and shows. All thanks to subtitles.

There‚Äôs that joke that women watch Netflix with subtitles because they suck at listening. Ha! Well, fuck it. Guilty as charged. Even before subtitles became the default, I would turn them on whenever possible because I just could not catch everything being said. Imagine me in the cinema, completely missing out on conversations because my ears refuse to function properly. And then it hit me today: watching with subtitles is basically just *reading*‚Äîbut with moving pictures! It gives you the bonus of seeing words in context *and* hearing them spoken naturally. Maybe it‚Äôs not as deep as reading books, but it‚Äôs still legit!

Honestly, I pause my shows all the time just to look up words or concepts I don‚Äôt understand from the subtitles. I‚Äôve picked up more vocabulary, idioms, malaphors, and random bits of knowledge this way than I ever expected.

And here I was, beating myself up for not reading books. Turns out, I‚Äôm still actually *reading*‚Äîand learning, too!"

"Finally when I have the money to buy it i have no purpose for it 
I was at a Guitar Show. There‚Äôs something beautiful about seeing such fine guitars truely work of art together and also having a chance to play them. 

The country and the city where I grew up I had to travel to different cities to find a proper a music instrument shop. To put into perspective famous brands like Fender, Ibanez, Gibson had to be imported on special orders.

As a teenager I remember even the most basic guitars would have been around 3-4 months of my old man‚Äôs salary so I started to learn on a 20$ guitar. 

I Practiced and played well. Performed wherever I got a chance. Seeing my dedication my dad helped me get a $500 Cort when I graduated. 

All of the above happened over 15 yrs and all this time I aspired to own a Gibson someday. Certainly dreamed about taking it to gigs and learning songs on it. 

Now I am 34, I can buy a Gibson quite comfortably. Money is not at all the problem. But I don‚Äôt play as much. No band. Honestly I think I just don‚Äôt have the purpose for it. Won‚Äôt hang a beautiful instrument on the wall. 

It‚Äôs a feeling I can‚Äôt explain. Neither am  I  sad nor am I complaining. Maybe I am little empty inside that‚Äôs why felt like sharing this.

At work and whenever I go to a restaurant or at the store, everyone looks so happy, socializing well, talkative, heck they all seem like normal people basically. I really feel like I'm the only one in the world that actually is lame and awkward when wanting to talk to people. I'm not too pissed about this in fact I kind of find it funny."

"There should be more female golf instructors. As a woman, I feel like I was never taught how to hit a golf ball correctly because my only instructors have been men. Not saying that men can‚Äôt teach women how to golf, but it always felt wrong having a guy tell me to focus on squatting, and the ball, and my arms, and my hips, standing still with my feet flat to the ground and then to ‚Äúswing my hips‚Äù. Like, how is a woman with an hour glass shape (or any shape) supposed to force herself to swing her hips? My hips will swing naturally whether you like it or not üòÇ. Telling me to swing them is not gonna make me hit a golf ball successfully. It‚Äôs only going to make me take a chunk of grass out because I forcefully, and unnaturally made my body move in a way that was over controlled.

"Why would someone be against posting on social media but still consume it excessively? I know people who argue that one should ‚Äúlive in the moment‚Äù and are either against posting on social media themselves or disapprove of those close to them doing so. Yet, ironically, they consume social media excessively‚Äîincluding content similar to what they refuse to post or even look down on others for sharing. For example, they might criticize someone for posting an Instagram story while out with friends at a restaurant, yet they‚Äôll eagerly watch and engage with similar posts from others. Or they might roll their eyes at people who share pictures of their meals but spend hours scrolling through food content online. So, Why would someone be against posting on social media but still consume it excessively?"

"Not knowing how other peoples thoughts work It's creazy to me that we don't know whats going on in other peoples minds, how they think, what they see... 

For example: I can think in dialogues. I hear my own voice in my head, speaking out what I think to somebody I know. I'm making full sentences in my head, in the same tempo as I would when I would speak out lout in real life. Then, the person in my head I'm talking to responds. However, this is more of a feeling, the other person doesn't make full sentences like I do. However, the result is that I am rethinking what I thought earlier, maybe clarifying what I said earlier, or even changing how I though about it earlier. 

Sometimes I do this about a specific subject for 30/60 minutes. This mostly happends after I've head some alcohol, but sometimes I also do this when sober.

"It's unsettling to realize that we're just tiny beings living on a small rock, adrift in the vast, endless expanse of space.

Have you ever seen that iconic photo of Earth taken from the Moon? It‚Äôs one of my absolute favorites because it perfectly captures how tiny and fragile our world is in the vast, ever-expanding void of space. 

I don't believe in aliens, so I often wonder if we‚Äôre really the only life out here. The universe seems like a massive, empty expanse filled with nothing more than scattered rocks and immense gas giants. And here we are‚Äîjust living our lives on one little rock, floating through the cosmic abyss. 

Honestly, I‚Äôm not even sure where I‚Äôm going with this, but I just needed to get it off my chest. It‚Äôs both unsettling and strangely liberating to realize our place in all this.

I never quite fall off that edge, but i'll just suddenly become intimately aware of how close it is in very fleeting moments. This is one of those moments.

I am quite well adjusted these days and am doing very well with my mental health. I've experienced severe psychosis in the past and other severe mental health problems. Im no longer depressed, i do still have OCD-type thoughts(not dxed) and only have that shake your head like an etchisketch compulsion, but no longer need to act on anything more complex compulsions at all. I no longer experience generalized anxiety or panic attacks ever. It's been about 7 years of living with a fairly stable mind.

I wish i could explain exactly why this happens or how i know. It just feels like i'm suddenly aware that my mental fortitude is weak. Like one small traumatic event could break the barrier holding it all back. Maybe this in itself is a symptom of a mental health issue currently unchecked. I dont feel distressed about it, it just feels matter-of-fact.

"""Peek"" and ""shake and slide"" may be good to be added in the next phones updates I miss Blackberry 10 alot and why don't add ""peek"" feature while holding the minimize gesture?

Not only for notification counts, we can use it for something like note-checking and weather. We can customize it and put it on the upper or below parts of the screen. This is my idea, the original one can only show the notification counts and it's on the left side

I got this inspiration because sometimes, I peek another app while using calculator to see what I want to count

Another one is ""shake and slide"". Because modern phone OSes task manager aren't like Blackberry, we need to shake first before we can slide to open news feed or homescreen side app or launch a favorite app. Gives haptic feedback after pulling and shaking the app screen

I pretended and imagined that I use the Blackberry Hub gesture when I minimize an app

"Why do humans collect and display things? I‚Äôve been wondering if there‚Äôs an underlying psychological explanation for some people‚Äôs drive to collect and display things?

Background, I like to collect things always have. More recently I‚Äôve made a conscious decision to be more selective about the things I collect and have shifted my thought process about my collections. Which I will elaborate more on in the comments if people are interested. 

But my curiosity stems from seeing (here and elsewhere) pictures of people‚Äôs elaborate collections and rooms/displays, mainly the large more elaborate and expensive ones, I can‚Äôt help but wonder why? 

Is being able to spend a six figure sum to acquire and curate a private museum the peak of human civilization? Is it just for status? Do people think their collections show their intrinsic value/good taste? Are people trying to venerate that which they are nostalgic for? Maybe I answered my own question, maybe there is no good answer. I‚Äôm just curious how others view this phenomenon. 

Last note, I‚Äôm asking this in good faith and I‚Äôm in no way trying to shame those with large expensive collections. "

"Unregulated and unchecked usage of the internet will lead to civilizations downfall What if the fall of mankind was not orchestrated by any individual bad agent, but instead emerged as a side effect of increasingly unchecked tech usage? Or rather, the cause of the fall of humanity arose as a side effect of increasing usage of unchecked tech usage.

The cause is this phenomenon of civilized barbarity. Humans have always been at odds with civility and barbarity. Man will Socratically rationalize with his neighbor one day, and destroy him by stones the next. This is fundamentally the cause that draws the fall of humanity: the rationalized barbarity. The fusion of Socratism and Aresism.

Technology provides an environment through which man increasingly becomes the rationalized barbarian. He now looks to his fellow neighbor and declares, ""Thou art my enemy -- it is with this information I declare war."" His barbaric deed being rationalized. Indeed, prior to technology - namely the internet - rational barbarity was still a present phenomenon; however, it was the networking of man that increased its scope. Instead of localized pockets, now, man can communicate with any other neighbor, a global forest of apes and one troop.

Now man has become fully connected in thought. Diametrically opposing ideas are able to formulate overnight and hence thereafter be used as a pretext for war. If mankind is allowed to freely bend the medium of communication as opposed to strict rules, then it is only a matter of time until diametrically opposing information bubbles up from the model and leads to the fall of humanity.

I mean just look the state of the United states today. Everyone is so polarized and I have seen increasing calls for violence on either side. 

All this to say: man himself (an indivual)  is not the central driving force but the people themselves."

"About the weakness of men in society. Your opinion? The main difference between the position of men and women in society is that women are allowed to be weak. All other social habits follow from this, which, however, I will not touch upon. If a man shows weakness it causes disgust, but if a woman shows weakness it causes a desire to protect her (from this comes the feeling of ""cuteness"" for example). I don't want to recognize ""men's rights to weakness"", much less fight for them, because, first - it's normal: alas, it's mostly just part of our biology, and second - we're unlikely to be able to instill a different view in society for at least the next 100 years.

Now the question: Does a man have any chance of remaining weak (if there is no other choice) but not to be miserable? I am not talking about accepting yourself ""as you are"", but about leading a normal life in such a situation. In what situation? Let's say it could be an incurable disease that makes you weak or some psychological trauma, etc.

I have this huge belief and happiness when I know someone who is in love.

I feel like people who are single especially for a long time or their entire life, it's valid to feel pessimistic about love, I feel like that too, but don't let it effect people you love too much, share your problems, but there's no need to offer them the same vibe.

I also really don't like here on Reddit when you look for dating advice, you get all these pessimists bringing other people's hopes down. It's rude and not needed.

"Hotel breakfasts closing at 10 am on weekends What kind of monster decided that 10 AM is a reasonable time to shut down a hotel breakfast on a weekend?

People are either sleeping in, recovering from travel exhaustion, or trying to enjoy a leisurely morning‚Äînone of which pairs well with an arbitrary 10 AM cutoff.

And let‚Äôs be honest, the food isn‚Äôt even good enough to justify waking up early. Half the time, the coffee tastes like regret, the eggs have the texture of a damp sponge, and the bacon is either a brittle, overcooked strip of sadness or a greasy, undercooked crime.

"I felt joy I‚Äôve been going to the terrace daily for the past few days. I go up on the roof and sit for some time to watch the sunset and listen to music. It brings me peace to watch the sky turn colours, from blue and white to pink and purple. And I would watch so many birds returning to their nests towards the east as the sun sets and it becomes dark eventually. They would mostly travel in groups or in pairs. They were also sometime single. They would often sit on the roofs and on lampposts and other things for breaks between flying. There‚Äôs a house on my street with a ladder on its roof that has this double bend on its top like a handrail. That is the topmost point of that house. The birds that fly in pairs would sit on them for a moment, one on each side of that ladder. This happened daily. At least one pair would sit on them daily without fail. Somedays more than one pair. Nowadays, I‚Äôm expecting that sight. I smile when that happens. Like a reflex. It brings me joy. I don‚Äôt know why I started noticing it or what‚Äôs so special about that sight, but two birds on the ladder of that roof makes me happy."
"A kid named Nick Today when I was at work, I got into a conversation with my co-worker about different types of kids we grew up with and saw in school. We both remembered that every school has that one kid who would pull their pants down the whole way at the urinal and we started laughing about it. He then proceeded to tell me about a kid who got made fun of so heavily for doing so, that he stopped using the boys' bathroom and started using the nurses bathroom. His story reminded me of a kid I knew back the day, and I felt like sharing my story about him. 

When I was in 6th grade, I moved to NY, and I was the new kid. I was socially awkward myself growing up and I had trouble making friends. So when I moved to NY and I fit right in, I held on to that selfishly. Where I'd usually spend time making friends with kids who didn't have friends, because I knew how that felt, I spent my entire 6th grade year with the ""popular kids"", because I finally felt accepted at the time. Mind you, I was 11 years old and I'm 21 now. 

There was this kid named Nick/Nicolas. He was known as the ""weird kid"". He wasn't actually super weird looking back at it, he was just socially awkward compared to the rest of the 6th graders. He'd be late to the bus sometimes and come in with his shoes and socks in his hands and kids would make fun of him because they'd see his bare feet. He picked his nose sometimes and even though every fuckin kid picks their nose, kids are cruel and made fun of him because they caught him in the act and he didn't hide it well enough. I didn't actually witness this go on, because he was in another class and I didn't see him except for recess. However,you'd sometimes hear it through the grapevine or hear a teacher telling another teacher or us about it when teaching us the importance of how bullying is wrong. So we all knew, but because we were kids and didn't see it, it wasn't our problem. He was never physically harmed and or bullied super super hard, but our 6th grade class was only made up of 3 classes. Mrs. Flynn's class, Mrs. Greisheimer's class, and Mrs. Bruno's class. And when its only 65-80 something kids in your entire grade and most of the kids pick on or tease you and everyone else hears about the ""weird things"" you do; it's gotta feel like shit. 

Now I've definitely gone thru my fair share of being bullied in my time. Such as being jumped 7 on 1, or getting a football thrown in my face in the dead cold of winter. I've had pictures of me sent around a school, I've had the entire gym class making fun of me because my hair was greasy one day. You know how alone and how shitty it makes you feel and I remember this one time in particular that was the whole reason for this reddit post, and even though I've never actually spoken a single word to Nick in my entire life, this makes me feel like shit and I could've done something but I didn't. 

During recess, we boys all played two hand touch football or soccer. Every day. One day though, like 5 minutes into recess, the ball went over the fence and we couldn't play football until the person watching us went to go get it. The person watching us was this 60 something year old woman who was really slow on her feet so we pretty much knew we weren't seeing that ball till the next day. Now Nick never played football with us. He knew he wasn't able to keep up(no offense Nick) and he knew he'd be picked last every time so he came in everyday with one of those tubes that held like 3-4 tennis balls and he'd play wall ball. He played wall ball every single day by himself. Nobody ever played with him, and nobody ever thought to because the girls were doing their thing and us boys were playing football or soccer. 

But on this day, we lost our football and the boys quickly migrated to Nick because he was the only one with a ball. The way his smile shined looking back, it makes me a little emotional. He was so happy. He finally had what he wanted- almost every boy in the 6th grade class was acknowledging him in a positive way. We were all playing wall ball with him and when I say it was an INTENSE GAME, it was INTENSE. Best wall ball game I've ever played. Shit was crazy. Now this is where shit gets fucked up. The old lady watching us didn't take as long as we thought and she came back with the football like 10 minutes later. As soon, and I mean as soon as she came back with that ball, everyone went right back to playing football. And there was this moment, I remember very clearly to this day. As all of us boys were walking off the black top and back to the field, I looked back real quick at Nick and he was just standing there. Not collecting his tennis balls or coming with us or anything at all. He was watching us walk back to the field with a blank look on his face, but his eyes told the whole story. The broken, defeated look in his face spoke volumes. He was just so upset that as soon as we got our ball back, we ditched him. He knew he was a 2nd choice right there and that's one of the shittiest moments in the world. And despite being bullied and knowing exactly how that feels, I was caught up in my own being accepted and I didn't give his situation much thought at all. In fact, I doubt I went home and said anything about it at dinner that night. But as I got older I remember that look and that moment and put the context clues together. And as I got older I always wished that I would've taken a few days out of that school year and played wall ball with him a few times or on that day, maybe finish recess with him rather than going back to the field as I did every other day. I don't know. I look back on it and I feel horrible because I know what that feels like. If you ever see this Nick, which I doubt you will, I hope you know I'm sorry and I hope you're doing better man. "

"What does ""moving on"" mean for you? Was having a conversation with a friend and remembered that ""moved-on"" or ""moving on"" can mean different things for a lot of people. For me, my definition is if it no longer triggers an extreme emotional reaction from me, I can think about it with neutrality or realism, then I've moved on or accepted it."
"Ghosting So I have seen a few questions / posts about ghosting people or people being ghosted and it's usually the along the lines of ""why do people ghost?! / It's so rude"" and so forth - either someone hoping the other would turn into a romantic relationship or by a new friend. I'm only referring to the NEW aspect.

The ghosting usually comes after some time has been spent together in some way (chatting or meeting up). I understand it's better to know than to guess, but would you rather be told said person isn't interested romantically or friend - which is usually pushed or questioned why - then to be told ""Because I don't like you"" (in the many different colourful ways)?

Not many people can be told this and be left feeling confident after. It eats at you, then the questions start, the insecurities... Yes, it is or can be cowardly, but because of technology, it's a means to spare feelings and walk away. I haven't ghosted anyone, I've never really been in that position, but I have been ghosted before and at the time it pissed me off, but when I thought about it, and now I just figure, there will be people who just don't like you.

Perhaps not the right sub, I'm sure you'll let me know."

I'm sick and tired of holding back things i wanna talk about because of the fear of looking self centered or people getting irritated because of me"
"Heart and mind coherence When the heart and mind align, intent becomes an unstoppable force. The heart, as the seat of true wisdom, provides the purest intention‚Äîrooted in love, purpose, and authenticity. The mind, as the architect of reality, refines and directs that intention with clarity and precision.

But it is intent that bridges the two‚Äîthe fire of commitment, the unwavering will to manifest thought into form. Without heart, the mind lacks meaning. Without mind, the heart lacks structure. And without intent, neither can create.

To move in true power, align your thoughts with your deepest truth, let your heart set the course, and ignite your will to act. This is coherence. This is creation. This is mastery."

We are heartbroken and watched her suffer for almost 5 yrs of extensive chemo treatments. My mom told us today if she were to ever get diagnosed, she would decline all treatments as she believes her best friend‚Äôs quality of life during chemo was zero and her condition only worsened. My dad said its easy to say that as a healthy person who has not been in that type of situation. I reminded her that there are plenty of people who survive and end up cancer-free but she is adamant that she would want that as she does not want to suffer.

"Why can't sign language be one of the worlds primary languages I feel like it would be so nice, Im not nor have I ever met someone who is deaf or mute, but I have a bad sore throat right now and its times like this where I wish everyone learned sign language (me included) it doesn't have to be just for the accessibility of deaf and mute people, it could be practical like during situations where you have to be quiet or its too loud to hear or something, and it could be used interchangeably with spoken languages as well, i dunno.

Edit: I didn't really think about this too much before posting, but I was def naive to think there was just a universal sign language. But still, spoken languages have dialects and language barriers, we still get around just fine. We could learn whichever sign language that is used in our area, and it could be used interchangeably when convient. Spoken languages would still be primary, but you could use sign language when its more convenient. Again, I wasn't really thinking of this because I pity deaf people or anything, it would def help them but mainly like just because feels practical? And if you're blind obviously people would still speak to you just as people use sign language to speak to deaf people. Interchangeably. And as a bonus everyone would be bilingual :D"

"Are Doritos (UK at least) hoping we will be absent minded? Here in the UK (I don't know if they have a similar offer elsewhere) they have a thing where if you find a square Dorito, you can win ¬£10,000. 

I had bought one of the promotional packs, and was looking at each one (more to work out the best angle to put in the dip), but as I neared the bottom of the bag, I noticed that I wasn't getting that many dipable ones. So I looked in the bag. 

It was clear that I had run out of the larger ones, so was just casually eating the remains. However, one of the broken ones I pulled out, happened to have broken in a roughly square shape. I joked to myself ""I wonder if they would accept this one?"". That then made think how many roughly square Doritos have I eaten without noticing. Which then made me think, has someone eaten one of the winning Doritos without realising?

So this then led to the thought, is that what Doritos is hoping for? Saying you're in with a chance of winning ¬£10,000 could boost sales. But how many people really pay attention to the shape when they are eating them? So maybe they want people to eat them without thinking, eat a winning Dorito, and then they don't have to hand over the money. 

So are they hoping we'll eat without noticing so they don't have to pay/not pay as many?

I've worked in retail for quite a while, and have seen my employers do some sneaky tricks to drive sales, while not making little to no lose. I can think of two off the top of my head. 

1- There was a bottle of water that had been 48p for ages, then it shot up to 60p. Two weeks later, they were on offer for ""2 for ¬£1"".

2- We had an energy drink that was price marked for ¬£1. We suddenly stopped getting them, and the none price marked cans were about ¬£1.50. About month later, they were on offer for ¬£1. After the offer finished, we slowly started getting the price marked cans again. 

So are they hoping we won't notice, so they don't have to pay/pay as many people?"

I make a lot of money, my wife does too. I don‚Äôt have a love for money, we are doing well and don‚Äôt have much stress aside from the day to day work stuff that happens. Kids are healthy. 

When I struggle to fall asleep; I start thinking of winning at least $20m and think of what my wife and I would do with it. A lot of it is repetitive. 

I fall asleep immediately. It clears my mind. 

Strange. "

"Feel heard I think I‚Äôve been going about this all wrong . I keep one account and don‚Äôt make any others so that I am not misunderstood and because I don‚Äôt get internet balls to just say whatever to whoever and own up to my comments and posts . It‚Äôs about saying what you mean and meaning what you say . But I don‚Äôt talk about things that divide us . I talk about life and how our differences are less than our similarities. But seems more fulfilling and way less accountability when you make fake ones so you can troll people and pretend you are just some random person on the internet to get information or inspiration or talk to someone who you aren‚Äôt sure knows what they put you into or through . I wonder what someone is trying to prove or disprove right now ‚Ä¶.is it about the chicken or the egg ? Because I thought I made it clear that rewording the question gets you the answer and that is YES !  Did the chicken come before the egg ? Yes !Did the egg come before the chicken? Yes . Im sorry but I‚Äôve been trying to find my way to clarity and not just content in the cloudy . And it got me here and since then alot of times what I read seems fairly obvious and when I comment it‚Äôs like suddenly it was just someone talking to the void . Soooo I guess we are the void ?

"I got addicted to phone (11hrs) and stopped reading for two years! This year I was determined to change that and I completed 4 books since late January. I love love love love love reading and I have been reading for past 10 years but I don't when I went from flipping pages to scrolling reels all day. My exams got over at 17th of jan and I probably would have gone back to scrolling and watching Netflix but I thought to myself: enough is enough! I borrowed a small book from a friend and from there I bought 4 books and completed them all. I am so happy I finally know what are phones actually for!  

I hope I don't lose myself to phone again. But I am really proud of myself as of now."
"My husband keeps me laughing to forget why I‚Äôm irritated with him. My husband (29M) and me (31F) have a great relationship and we laugh all the time. He‚Äôs VERY funny and quick-witted.

Yes there are bad days too but those are necessary to appreciate the good! I know death is scary for many, but think of it like this - it's kind of amazing because it allows us to appreciate this and it allows room for other souls to later come and explore this world without it being uncomfortably crowded!

"This boy comes barging into my life like a parade of green flags ‚ô•Ô∏è He is always asking me if I‚Äôm hungry or if he can make me anything. Last Saturday night, I came by to see him before I went out dancing, and he fixed a plate for me. He really made sure that I ate before I left.

He wrote me a poem (he‚Äôs a novelist) for our third date. He gave a copy of his novel as a first-date present and he wrote a note about one of the things we spoke about. 

He‚Äôs texting me everyday to ask how my day‚Äôs been. He stops and stares at me to tell me, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre beautiful. You‚Äôre really beautiful.‚Äù We laugh all the time and he kills me with cuddles.

Last time, when I walked into his place, he was playing his guitar and he said that we were going to sing songs (I like to sing for fun). I couldn‚Äôt because I was sick, but I‚Äôm really looking forward to that. "

MY TOXIC ROOMMATE FINALLY MOVED OUT AND I COULDN‚ÄôT BE HAPPIER WITH THIS CHANGE :) Hi everyone. It‚Äôs been one hell of a week with so much drama going on between me and my former roommate. For starters alot of stuff that happened between us was because of her and her actions. She decided to cut me off without talking about anything and today is when she finally moved into a different room. I was still sad tho because she couldn‚Äôt even look me in the eyes and apologize even when I heard our mutual friend getting mad at her for causing all of this to happen to begin with. But I‚Äôm just so happy to finally have that toxic person out of my room. I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôve been taking care of myself more with her gone and been in top of work/ hobbies I haven‚Äôt done in a while. I love to read and haven‚Äôt done so in a while till now. Even tho I am getting therapy because of all that‚Äôs happened I still am happy to be moving forward and doing what‚Äôs best for me. Thanks for reading if you did I hope u have a wonderful day :)
"Made it to final round of interviews for moonshot job opportunity - happy regardless of outcome! A month or so ago, I saw a job posting on LinkedIn for a senior engineering role at a well-known San Francisco based company.  The combination of role and company peaked my interest. As I began to read the description, it dawned on me that I am definitely qualified for such a role. Two seconds later, I realized that there were well over 1k applicants just through LinkedIn alone. I thought, well shit, there's no chance - this is just a moonshot. Fuck it, though, I will apply.

This opportunity helped me find motivation and courage to finish and publish some technical articles and open-source code that I had in the works but never had the motivation to finish prior. I then updated my resume and sent off my application, not really expecting to hear anything. 

To my (legitimate) surprise, I heard back directly from a recruiter within THREE DAYS of submitting my application. Usually it takes weeks or longer to hear back, if you even hear back at all. We scheduled some time to chat, and it went well. Now, fast forward several weeks, and I just made it past my initial coding screening, and am moving into the final round which consists of four virtual interviews all back-to-back in the same day. 

At this point, even if I do not get an offer, this has served as such a huge motivation booster for me. I didn't even think I would hear back, but yet, out of over 1k applicants, here I am going into the final round. Plus, it helped me get over my fear of sharing my knowledge publicly, as I actually finished and published some articles/repositories. A win no matter what, and it makes me happy!"
"by the end of the month I‚Äôll finally hit my biggest financial goal of the last several years (21F) Once my tax return hits my account and I get my next paycheque, I‚Äôll have finally reach over $10k in my emergency fund account and also have extra to put towards my long term savings and family trip this year!! 

I know it‚Äôs not really a lot of money, but I only make minimum wage, and  the last couple years I made the mistake of putting myself in nearly 40k bad debt and it was really weighing on me.  I‚Äôve had nearly 20k saved in my account at times because I‚Äôm an aggressive saver, but last year I was so tired of the debt and the interest that I decided to use almost my entire savings to pay off as much debt as I could, which was an scary decision for me but it was worth it to get out of that situation.  For the last year I have been working extra, and being really frugal and strict with my spending so that I can finally build back my savings from 0 and not have that anxiety looming over me. $10k with no debt feels so much better than that $20k with debt ever did.


I‚Äôm just really happy to have accomplished recovering from those bad decisions and no longer have that weight on my shoulders. I can finally use my money for my long term savings and financial goals instead of stupid debts. I can relax, I don‚Äôt need to work so hard and I no longer have to stress whenever I spend money on fun things. It‚Äôs a huge relief. I can move on to better things "
The weather was phenomenal this weekend so my boyfriend and I went to the farmers market and he got me a gorgeous bouquet üíê 
"Working out consistently has changed my life Four months ago i quit smoking and started working out 3x a week - minimum. 

I had been addicted to weed for a little more than two years. I lost 40lbs in the span of a year, mostly because I prioritised smoking over eating or doing hobbies. I was high all the time except for work and when I met up with family. I wasn‚Äôt living, I was just staying alive. 

Now I work out 3-5 times a week, and I LOVE IT! I‚Äôve started taking it more seriously, eating more protein, eating more in general, drinking water and getting enough rest. Also taking supplements like creatine and multi vitamins, and prioritising journaling and limiting social media. 

Im happy to say I feel better than I have in years. I‚Äôve got more energy, more time for friends and family, and my head is clearer. Friends and family tell me I look better, and those that knew me well are pleasantly surprised with all the changes I‚Äôve made for the better. 
I love my life, and seeing the gains is just more motivation to keep going. I can‚Äôt wait to see where I‚Äôm at in 3 months, 6 months, and a year!

Don‚Äôt know where I was going with this, but I‚Äôm very happy!

"For the first time in my life I finally got to pay for something for my parents A few days ago I went out to get something from my school with my dad. The road to my school was narrow and was getting worked on so we couldn't go by car.

Since I always take public transportation to get there I know how much to pay and stuff, being able to pay the driver for me and my dad felt so nice, tho I couldn't pay for the ride back since I ran out of change.

It was a small thing but I hope when I finally get a job I can buy them something more. "

"First-round job interview tomorrow and I might for the first time ever get a job I actually like!! Didn't check my email for a few days after sending in the application because 1) I wasn't very hopeful and 2) previous employers have mostly contacted me by phone. Checked it today and saw a two-day-old email saying they would love to have me in for a first-round interview!! I was so jolted as I checked their open dates against the calendar - heart beating, mouth dry and everything lol. It's a new cafe that's about to open up soon and the owner seems like a cool person with appealing ideals for her business, AND the kind of social vibe that helps me feel at ease - the pay is good for the kind of job it is, too. She seems to be putting much more thought into the running of it than many businesses around here do, IMO. It's shaping up to be the kind of place that would get me as a customer even if they didn't hire me as an employee. But I'm hoping they hire me. We'll see! Anything could happen, my hiring is far from certain before I've even had a first interview, the business could turn out differently than my impression makes me expect - we live in that kind of world - but I'm just letting myself be excited and hopeful for now!"
"I am happy for the first time in years and it took a tragedy to get me there I am an autistic adult.

For the first time since do not know when, I am happy. I feel happy, my friends mention that my demeanor is happier, and just in general i feel better as a whole. 

But this scares me. I am not really sure how to explain it. But I have been miserable overall for so long, I am not used to this feeling.

I took care of my disabled mother for 11 years, this took a horrible toll on my life, emotionally. Since her passing in November, I have been working with autistic kids in a school, and absolutely love it. I wake up looking forward to work. On my days off, miss work."

"My dad told me I was a great parent today. I'm a 30 father and I texted my father, that I loved him. And ussually whenever I do he believes I'm sad or somethings wrong. And he's ussually not wrong. But today I just wanted to, but figured I'd tell him about a recent thing bothering me. And he came back with the best response, and telling me how great a father I've turned out to be and everything. 

And I just want to say it made me happy. I know he knows in a good father, he's said it before. But the way he said it today made me so happy. If you have kids who are parents and you read this. And think the same thing of your kids. Tell them. It means alot to us. "

"I'm the luckiest daughter ever and I love my parents I can't believe it took me so long to realize how amazing of a life they created for me.They did absolutely everything right and I have to stop taking all of it for granted and trying to find reasons to be sad.

My life is AMAZING and it's all because of them.

I always had food and a roof over my head.

They always steer me in the right direction without pressuring me. 

They did a fantastic job with saving and finances as young adults and that gave me a fantastic headstart in life.

and most importantly they gave me love.

I want to scream all of this from the rooftops everyday, but I realize that a lot of people never had any of it so I'm here writing this post.

Everyone deserves a life like this and I can't express how grateful I am to be ""the chosen one""'

"After years of being distrustful and avoiding relationships. I'm getting married I can't believe that I'm saying this. For a long time now, I was in doubt that I would ever meet someone who could make me feel so safe, complete, joyful, and beloved. We make a great team, and I don't doubt the longevity of our relationship for a second. It's almost impossible for me to believe that this is finally happening. I grew up with an extremely abusive family, and my parents argued a lot. This made me dread living out the same fate. I became super careful around the smallest of red flags, so I spent a lot of time rejecting anyone who managed to get close. I started dating at 18 but remained till 26 single

I never went past the talking stage with anyone. It was a long cycle of me just finding red flags during the texting stage just before we could even go on a date. Even if I got to the dating stage, I would have to sneak out and find an excuse to be gone for a couple of hours. My family is super controlling and religious. Unless the guy belongs to their religion, they wouldn't accept him. I secretly left their faith. Therefore, I can't stand to marry someone from it to continue pretending for life

I left when I realized that my happiness and theirs are mutually exclusive. They made this clear to me in more ways than one. They would chide, mock, and remind me of my shortcomings, and if I got anything right, it would be either forgotten or belittled. Gaining their love was a sisyphean punishment. There was absolutely no saving our familial bond. No option but to runaway. They didn't allow me to move out on my own because of religious rules against it. Thankfully, the country we are in doesn't follow these terms, so I'm free to go since I'm a legal adult. I needed help to pull this off, and that's where he got in the picture 

I've turned down such offers of help before because I felt something off about the person. It's a lot of trust that I just couldn't risk. I preferred to make my own income to avoid this, but then I felt something fundamentally different about him from other men I've known. 

You've ever met a complete stranger, but they give off such a wonderful, positive vibe that you feel like you could hand them your kid in an emergency without a second thought? That's the best way I could describe him. Another green flag for me is that he treats people who he gets zero benefits from with the same level of care and respect. Everyone and anyone who knew him or got to know him grew to love him significantly 

It's been a year since we've met, and he's still the same hero I thought he was. Nothing changed since he wasn't putting up an act to win me over. I'm designing a custom brooch for his wedding suite now and can't wait to surprise him with it"

Just wanted to share this pic of myself being happy. Cruised to the west Indies last winter and it was one of the happiest times of my life.   Sometimes when I'm sad I look back at some pictures and just reminisce and it brings back some of the joy.   
"A childhood angel I never met again, a lasting memory When I was in 1st standard/grade, I studied in a private school in Kerala, India for just a month. I was a shy kid, and had a lot of social anxiety. In my class, there was this girl who used to smile at me every day, but we never really talked. Funny thing is, I never even asked her name, and to this day, I don‚Äôt know it. She was one of the few girls who didn‚Äôt bully others. I still remember‚Äîshe had these tiny little hairs above her lips, which made her look even cuter.  

One day, after PT(physical training) period, I lost my pencil while playing on the ground. The next class after PT was maths, when I got back to class, I asked the classmates sitting beside me if they had an extra pencil, but they all had only one. Our maths teacher was very strict, not friendly at all. Class started ,she started writing on the board, noticed that I wasn‚Äôt writing, and asked me why. When I told her I lost my pencil, she got angry and started scolding me loudly in front of the whole class. Then she told everyone not to give me a pencil, if anyone dares to do the opposite she will beat them. I was on the verge of crying.  

Just then, another teacher came and called her outside and she left . 
As I sat there, feeling helpless, I suddenly felt a tap on my back. I turned around and saw that same girl holding out a pencil for me. She told me to take it. I was shocked, of all the people in the class, she was the only one who defied the teacher‚Äôs order. In that moment, her kindness meant everything. To our luck that the math teacher didn't come back,she and I were saved from scoldingüòÖ. I used the pencil, and before school ended, I returned it to her. I wish I had said more that day, but I was just a shy kid who didn‚Äôt know how to express gratitude properly.  

A few days later, I was transferred to another school, and that was the last time I ever saw her. But even after all these years, I still remember that moment. Life has taught me how rare it is to find such genuine kindness in the world.  That moment, her gesture‚Äîsmall as it may have seemed‚Äîstayed with me. Because now, as an adult, I realize how hard it is to find people like her in this world.

If by any chance you‚Äôre reading this, it‚Äôs highly unlikely, but still, I truly hope you‚Äôre doing well in life and you were one of the few people who showed kindness to me. And who knows? Maybe one day, we‚Äôll meet again. "
The last time I was actually filled with happiness and couldn‚Äôt contain myself. It was nice 
"The guy I've liked for 2 months maybe more went to a dance. I am dying of joy. He is amazing I love him so much. He asked me to a dance and I agreed, at the time it was platonic as he was dating a toxic human(sorry for mention) they've broken up for over a month. A friend realized that we both loved eachother. So uhh he asked about what friend said this is the messages. We are not labeled but he likes the idea of dating. Holy shit.  My second crush. And my first lover?"

These guys go to the park every day and feed the homeless, they all volunteer and give up a few hours each day to do this they are the nicest people you will ever meet and I got to talk with them and share their food. There is love much love in this world, you just have to look in the right place. "

I was starting to feel depressed and then I felt better after I saw my paycheck. I got my check from my new job today. I was starting to feel depressed because I felt overworked from my job and also because because a lot of stuff in my personal life. But then I opened my bank account to see if my paycheck got here yet. It did. And it was also a decent amount. I am actually happy about it cause now I know I will at least be okay financially as long as I keep this job. I am not rich but I am happy that I have enough to pay my bills and have a little extra left over incase.
"After 13 years, I am so happy. Apparently I need a 40 character title. Simple was just so easy. So 12 yrs ago I got hit crossing the street, was wintertime and dark. Spent 3 months in hospital and another 4 in re hab learning to walk. Shit has always been a a pain in the ass to walk. Painful swelling legs killing me. Ended up being homeless for for a few years. Finally got a place and I hate to say this, but thanks to covid. Still shit sucked, can't get around. Grocery shopping was having to walk home over .5 miles. Shit sucked ass, found out about e bikes. Saved for over 2 years and finally bought 1. Trike. I am so happy now, I can enjoy freedom to do what I want for once in 13 years. Only thing I hope for now is not geting hit by another car on my new e-bike."

Now I'm feeling a lot better, just got my 13 cavities filled, feeling alright mentally but I'm happy I've taken care of myself."
"I GOT THE LAST OF MY 13 CAVITIES FILLED TODAY I genuinely feel like a new man. (Well, boy cause im not an adult. But still. )

I've been struggling with mental health (mainly depression/anxiety) for a LONG time. When it hit I barely took care of myself, but last year, before Halloween, I got 13 cavities from my caffeine addiction. Now, jump cut to about maybe 12 hours ago where I went into the dentists office and got the FINAL cavity I had filled up!! 

I'm really proud of myself for keeping it up this long. I hope it lasts. I don't wanna fall back into that depressive state like before and I wanna be able to keep this up. I don't wanna go into adulthood not feeling mentally OK or not being able to take care of myself.. "

As I said, I've never done this before, I wasn't sure how to layer, where to place things, co-ordinate height, types, colours and such, but yeah, I like how they came out. My mum said they looked professional so that made me happy!"

"Finally made me realize that the love outweighs everything Happy 3 years <3 I have been really struggling with mental health issues lately, but there is one person in my life who has done anything. I used to think that with my BPD i could never have a long term relationship. I thought that i was always better off alone so I didn‚Äôt get jealous or hurt anyone. This person has worked his butt off for three years and I have realized how truly happy I am with him. I‚Äôd rather stay with him through thick and thin. I have nowhere to say this, besides here. If you see this, I love you. I have truly never felt as understood and listened to until now. You‚Äôve done so good. "
"Two asexuals in a non romantic relationship For the first time in my life, I‚Äôm not skeptical or suspicious of any form of danger or ulterior motive.

I don‚Äôt believe this is very common and feel this is a rare occurrence (did surface level research). 

I (33F) never thought I‚Äôd find my person (38M).

It feels too good to be true and feel highly blessed regarding this dynamic. We are two individuals who are different yet eerily similar in many ways. I never thought I‚Äôd find another person who sees and thinks in the same light as me yet is unique in their own ways that is intellectually stimulating with desirable traits. 

For the first time in my life I feel:
-safe
-trust
-support
-transparency 

From what‚Äôs been gathered through our conversations, we both see the start of a long term dynamic. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I felt a true emotion of excitement. More importantly, no pressure of sex. I‚Äôm overjoyed.

In the past, I‚Äôve experienced a variety of trauma from early childhood until recent. This new sense of established peace is uplifting and for once I feel a sense of hope. 

That‚Äôs all, I just want to share the start of this new chapter to someone!

"I ate shrimp two days in a row and I'm happy about it I know, I know I posted about siomai a few days ago in this subreddit. I couldn't help but be happy with food though, sorry for that. Ok yesterday, my family and I had a celebration outside because my sisters and I passed all subjects and entered with honors. We had noodles, (DIY noodles) and I chose a spicy noodles with extra seafood and mmmmm it was yummy. And earlier we had shrimp for dinner. Idk if I'm happy because I passed the exams, or because I ate shrimp. In 10th grade my former best friend, (we'll call her the first letter of her name for privacy purposes) M and I used to cook foods in her house and our last food we cooked was buttered shrimp, which was our dinner in the family earlier. This was in 2023, and she and I lost touch, because we both have hectic schedules. The food is delicious and nostalgic, I passed my exams, I had bonding time with my family, and honestly, I kinda needed that break, due to the drama last Thursday (would prefer not to tell).

"I know the last time I picked up my kids One thing I heard / read (probably on Reddit somewhere) was that a parent picks up their kids many times over many years‚Ä¶but one of those times is the last time it ever happens and you just don‚Äôt know it. 

That seemed sad to me, so I made a promise to myself to note every time I picked up one of my kids. It was easy, just a note on my phone - I just needed the dedication to update the note each time. 

So now, my kids are too tall and heavy for me to pick up and carry, but I get a smile on my face every time I think about it because I know the exact date and time I last picked up both of my kids. 

My kids don‚Äôt know I have this happy little secret. I‚Äôll probably tell them in a card for some special occasion, or I‚Äôll leave it as a note in my will. But it makes me happy that I can definitively remember when I was last able to pick them up and carry them."

- Caught up with two of my best mates that I've known since we were 12 years old. We spent the evening at a club that was central to all of us and just talked and laughed until all hours. It is a friendship that has lasted over 34 years, we all have changed so much but we can easily fall back to our youth and laugh and joke. It was such a fun and happy evening. I even told them about this list that I do each day.
- When I went to the bathroom at the club, it was crowded with a younger crowd, probably 18-22 year Olds, I was at thenurinal and let rip a very big fart, the bathroom started snorting with laughter. "
"I‚Äôve made it! Im off the streets for at least a week. 
Been homeless for over 2 months now after suffering depression and losing my job on the process. Was so close to giving up several times but I managed to stick it up thanks to my dog who was there when nobody else was.

Just got my first paycheck from my new job and I managed to get a motel that allows dog for a week. I was so reluctant at first on spending chunks of my paycheck but it was all worth it. I finally slept without worrying about my stuff getting stolen and not having to sleep with one eye open.

I have 40 to get some dog food and food for myself for the next 2 weeks after paying several debts. Any advice on how I‚Äôd survive until I get my next paycheck? There‚Äôs no food banks nearby which kinda sucks. Any program as well where I can apply for free bus pass? Ive been walking in freezing cold and it‚Äôs rough but I dont want to spend the remainder of my money on bus pass coz that would mean we wouldnt have food."

We all made reports , after checking the players stats which logically did not add up , and went about our gaming night .

"Got a gym membership last month, been going nearly every day since, and I'm so proud of myself for starting to exercise It's something I've been needing to do since forever. Growing up, my parents never tried to enforce healthy habits. Because of that, I've been overweight nearly my entire life. Tried not to let it bother me since there wasn't much i could do about it. But last month, I got a gym membership, and I've been going nearly every day since. My body feels SO much better. My legs in particular feel stronger. I've even lost a tiny bit of weight already. I'm also starting to watch my calories, and I'm trying to eat more veggies. I dont like such a fat slob anymore. I'm just really proud of myself for doing it, and I hope I can keep it up for a while.

"My grandmother's cat is back home after being lost for over three months! My grandmother's indoor cat snuck out in November. My grandma is a widow who lives alone and this cat is an extremely beloved companion. She was devastated. And we were so scared for the cat with how cold and snowy it has been in our part of the country these past few weeks. Not to mention coyotes had been spotted in the neighborhood recently...

We tried a lot of the standard advice to find lost cats, made posters, reported her missing to local animal organizations and shelters, but nothing came of it. A neighbor saw her two weeks ago but she got scared and bolted when the neighbor tried to open their door to let her in.

Two days ago, we finally caught her in an old possum trap! She is very dirty, very skinny, very matted, and very tired, but she is home and safe. She slept and drank so much once she was brought inside. 

She has been to the vet and been treated for the eye and ear infections she picked up, and has been given a special food to gain weight back. Grandma says she is going back to her favorite places in the house and curling up in them. Just so, so happy she is back."
"A random gymbro complimented me after I was underweight for my entire life My BMI has been in the lowest category for my entire life, I'm really fucking skinny and always have been, no matter what I tried. 

6 months ago after a breakup and her sleeping with someone else my self esteem was in the gutter, so I decided ""fuck this shit"" and started working out. 

We're now 6 months later where I have gone to the gym 3x/week, and yesterday a random buff guy in the gym and I started talking. 

He said he remembered when I first came in that I looked incredibly skinny, and that since then I've gotten alot bigger. He congratulated me on my progress and taking the step to start working out and hopes I can keep it up. 

That was a ""core memory unlocked"" moment right there, being complimented on my physique after feeling insecure about it my entire life. 

Thank you gymbros, you people are some of the kindest I've ever met. I'm more determined than ever to keep going now. "
"My son told me on the phone he misses me! I felt loved. I am with my kids more of their days and they always ‚Äúmiss‚Äù dad and dad is always more fun. Of course, I am the one that disciplines more, ensure they eat heathy, do homework and ‚Ä¶. So, I am not always the fun one for them I guess. Sometimes I feel like they don‚Äôt realize how much I do for them! I feel taken for granted. Today I left to work my night shift at the hospital but called them to say good night before going to bed and my son told me in the phone that he missed and wished I was home with them. I felt loved and seen!! Love my family, my husband is amazing and my kids are the love of my life!! Thanks for the family I have!"

"Today is such a good day and I just wanted to share. So nothing extremely exciting is currently happening at the moment but we finally moved and got a shit ton done since last Saturday! Now we just need a couch and little decorations and stuff. And I realise how silly this is going to sound but I did the majority on my own because my hubby is on a work trip and had to leave a few days after we moved here. He's going to be gone for a little over a week but I want to get as much done before he gets back. 

I've just never done any of this on my own before or really ever had my own place (long and sad story I will spare y'all from) but the amount of confidence I got from just setting up our WiFi, our TV, and kitchen stuff has made me feel more self sufficient and given me such a happy boost of well needed confidence. I'm just so happy and I can't share it with him yet because I want it all to be a surprise. We already picked out the stuff we want and most of it, other than the couch, will be here tomorrow! I might have to wait on some things because I'm sure I'm forgetting some things but the best part is that I found most of it for really cheap at Home Goods. I'm just really happy and wanted to share with strangers because this subreddit is so adorable. 


If you made it this far, thank you for reading! 


**Edit**: If it's not too much trouble and if anyone has any advice on what else I should get and feels comfortable sharing, please let me know! I also got hubs something but in the off chance he sees this, which I doubt it, I'm gonna keep that to myself. "

"Took a baby step out of my comfort zone today and sharing my work for the first time :') Ok so even this is kind of scary to post but... I made a thing and I'm really happy about it! üôà

I've always been really shy, I love creating, but I'd make stuff but keep it locked away because showing anyone felt absolutely terrifying.

But I had this idea for a simple planner app because I needed one for work (trying to figure out where all my time goes lol). Instead of just keeping it on my computer like usual, I thought ""hey, maybe someone else in the world would also find this helpful?""

So yeah, I'm sharing my work. It's called Timeleaf - just a cozy little weekly planner with time tracking. Nothing fancy, but it's mine and I'm kind of proud of it üå±

This probably feels really silly, since I'm still posting anonymously - but still feels like overcoming some sort of mental barrier I've had for a long time, and I think I should celebrate it! Baby steps, right?

"I‚Äôm getting my appliances delivered today after 5 months in a camper from Hurricane Helene!!!! Man‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been a journey to get here.

Back in September, our house flooded with three feet of water. We had to buy a camper and live in it while the entire place was gutted and rebuilt from the ground up.

We‚Äôve been eating takeout every single day because there was no way to cook in the camper. Laundry? That‚Äôs been a weekly laundromat trip since there was no space for a washer and dryer during the remodel. Even the little things‚Äîlike a dishwasher or just having a mirror‚Äîwere gone. You don‚Äôt realize how much those everyday luxuries mean until they‚Äôre taken away.

But today‚Ä¶ today is a milestone.

After weeks of delays and backorders, our appliances are finally arriving. In an hour, we‚Äôll have a fridge, a stove, a washer, a dryer‚Äîeverything we‚Äôve been missing. And once they‚Äôre in, we can finally get our countertops installed.

This has been a long, exhausting road, but man, I have never been more excited for a delivery in my life."
"I got fired and I am happier than I've been in month! I worked for a company for 3 years where I would write articles for people who have moved abroad. It was honestly an amazing job. I was working from home (able to travel the world) most times, I got creative freedom to write any content I wanted. I built my schedule as long as it was meeting my hours. I made incredible connections. I had a fixed salary with benefits. 

What made it even better was this was my first corporate job coming out of university AND I got the right to stay in the country I studied in. 

Honestly, everything was really good! 



So, why am I so happy to get fired?

This job had a lot of great aspects to it, but in the end it came down to the people I worked with. Even working from home, I had meeting with my colleagues and I overall felt like I wasn't really apart of the team after awhile. I felt I couldn't ask questions or make mistakes, I wasn't growing and I just hated everytime Monday came around. 

So when they fired me, I was upset, but it felt like my biggest fear had come true. I would lose my residency and have to move back home (which isn't a bad option). However, even though it feels like I have a million things to do and I will have to leave this country, I feel free, happy, capable and ready to start something new. 

In the end, I don't have any bad blood with anyone, but I am kind of glad they fired me because it's giving me the push I need to become more. 

Side note, I realize I am so privileged! I have had amazing opportunities. I am in a better position than others. 

Anyways, thanks for reading. I hope you have a good day üòä"

* My daughter needed to come home early and see and head to the hospital because she suffered a concussion. She was cleared and nothing was of concern. I did however have a really fun time with her for the 9 hours it took to get the final sign off and we left the hospital. We made fun of the silly things that happened and just made a few jokes and mucked around a little with the adjustable bed.

"I miss siomai and I couldn't help but feel nostalgic and happy. Is this normal? I miss siomai. I'm not sad about it, hahaha, I'm actually happy. We were doing homework about food editing, and I felt nostalgic when I saw siomai on Google, it's legit one of my favorites. I know, I know, it's childish to feel happy with food and that I'm too old for it, but I can't help but feel happy and nostalgic. My friends and I used to bond a lot about it, they also eat it from time to time, food's delicious, brings a lot of happy memories, honestly, I'm just really happy, idk why hahaha, has anyone else been this happy about food? Or am I exaggerating? Aside from it's delicious taste, it brings a lot of sentimental value. Idk man, I'm literally craving it rn. 

Update: I had siomai for breakfast today, one day after I posted this. What a coincidence. My parents did not know I'm craving it, yet still had siomai hehe. Love you mon & dad ü•∞"
"silly and little and violent,finally I got my revenge against people that doesn't exist lol So, I have this thing in my head that makes me have existencial crisis against my core values, and two of them are: life is a serious thing ( not saying there's no humour), and moral.


And one time I was in this really bad crisis, and in my mind there where like five-four dudes that were making fun of me, that caused me a lot of the crisis, and I could see them laughing.

I finally got over it and then, some days ago, I had another crisis: another topic, another mental image of a guy.

(These mental images do a lot on worsening my state of peace)

And then it was like something made click on my mind, and I imagined the guy getting hurted, really hurted, like bear-hurted.

and then I remembered the four-five guys, and in my mind I hurted them like I would never hurt anyone in real life.

I realized with the another thought, that they were in *my* head, so I had the power to make them stop laughing, and that I had the power to make them bleed.

And, as they have hurted me, I wanted to really hurt them too.


I know this is not that serious of a thing, but finally feeling like I got a little revenge against that thoughts, really made me feel better"

"I‚Äôm so happy I‚Äôm regaining memories and mobility I‚Äôm 18 now and I‚Äôve been dealing with a brain tumor since I was 13 1/2. I was going blind, I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed anymore and had migraines that had me screaming and sobbing for it to stop. The tumor erased almost all of my memories and I lost who I was and I couldn‚Äôt remember something somebody would have told me a couple hours prior. 2 weeks ago I got the clear that all of my levels are going to a normal teenage range and it‚Äôs shrinking dramatically. I may even get to stop my nightly shots eventually which is torture now that my scar tissue keeps building up. Lately I suddenly have regained all of my memories and I feel almost reborn. I‚Äôm cleaning my room again, I just moved houses and I‚Äôm actually getting things done when I never used to. I just wanted to share this with people to know that if you have a medical condition, sometimes there‚Äôs the hope that may come true of getting better. Even if it‚Äôs not fully recovered, it‚Äôll get better. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π 
EDIT:
Wow thank you so very much for everyone‚Äôs kind comments I really appreciate it!! I‚Äôm so excited for my future and what will come when I‚Äôm fully recovered üíïüíïü´∂

I live in Arizona and used to go to trips to the Sierra Nevada mountain range to be in complete solitude and at peace away from civilization. I inherited 100k and have no living relatives apart from one uncle who lives across the USA and my father who abandoned me and my late mother when I was 13. I plain on living off of the 100k and using my car as a house until I can find a way to live off the land. I‚Äôm an avid hiker and outdoorsman and there‚Äôs parts of the mountain range which are very quiet and empty and I plan to be there.

"True love really does exist and it‚Äôs just the small things that matters most. (Valley day dump) 
On Valley Day my man decided to gift me with 4 bouquet of flowers. I love roses so much but I have NEVER been gifted with 4 bouquets at once. He also bought me chocolates and I was VERY appreciative. We decided to go to cicis pizza (currently my fav spot for some odd reason right now) and play this game called It Takes Two on PS5. Lots of bonding and intimacy when we went to cicis. We just talk to one another love on one another. I just really appreciate him lots. I can't wait till we get married in the future.


P.S. Everytime he buys me flowers. I dry them out so we can use them at our wedding. The flower girl is gonna come down the aisle with them. Ofcourse we will spray paint the rose petals the color that we want so the rose petal will be in uniform. But BYE guys. Thanks for coming to my ted talk."

"I hosted a Galentine‚Äôs Day Tender Friends Chicken Tender Party and it was a huge success! It was a labor of love, and here I am looking very proud of my efforts ü•π The party was complete with 3 flavors of homemade chicken tenders - Buffalo, Spicy Malaysian Red Curry, and Lemon Pepper. Below is everything else I made: 

* Arugula and shaved fennel salad with blood orange and Aleppo pepper vinaigrette

* Twice baked potatoes

* Cheese and meat and fruit plate

* Mocha mousse with homemade meringues

* Homemade red velvet cupcakes with cream cheese frosting

* Batch espresso martinis

I also curated a good sleep, good skin self-care package for each guest which included a sleep mask, scarf, and skin cleanser set and chocolate truffles. My friend made homemade soaps for all the guests too. 

This was a bittersweet event as we were celebrating an upcoming wedding, our friend purchasing her first home, but also the going away of another friend so I went all out to make it a really special event for everyone. I started cooking the night before and it took all day starting at 7 AM to cook and assemble everything. 

I‚Äôm really proud of how the event turned out! It brings me a lot of joy to host gatherings and I don‚Äôt get to do it often enough. 

Also I promise the rose is NOT near the flame; it‚Äôs just the perspective of the photo. And we blew that one out shortly after the pic was taken üòú

"My landlord cares about me so much and really supports me I have been independent since Christmas.  I managed to move out of my abusive family's home into a rental situation where I would rent a bedroom in a house for 400 a month.  Pretty good deal in my opinion, because I won't have to pay bills, and I don't mind living in bedrooms since I lived a recluse lifestyle.  The landlord owns the house and lives with us, and let me tell you, he is just the coolest and most interesting dude.

First things first, I don't have a car, so I was worried about how I was going to move all of my stuff, and he legit offers to pick me up and help me move to his house and refuses my offer to pay him gas.  The entire time, he's kind, nice, and interesting.  He works a really badass job and is also a veteran.  I was so impressed by his house as he lives in basically a mansion in a gated community that has a golf course on it.  The house is nice af, and all the other roommates are so cool, clean, and quiet.  I made good friends with all of them and we help each other out with rides, we share snacks, that sort of thing.

My landlord is really kind and nice.  He didn't charge me until 2025 since it was so close to news years, and he was worried about me.  We had a huge snowstorm, and it was cold in my bedroom and I had no bedding.  My landlord bought me a spaceheater and a duvet comforter and told me I didn't have to pay him back.  He's so damn generous.  He always buys all of us snacks and offers to buy us stuff in general if the offer comes up.  He also does not judge me for not having a license or a car, and drives me places I need to go while also teaching me how to drive!  He doesn't even roll his eyes or anything.  

He also REALLY cares about me.  Last night, I missed college because I was unable to make it back to my dorm room before my landlord had work, and when he find me still home this morning asleep about to miss class, he had a legit angry MELTDOWN about me not being at school.  He legit yelled at me about my future, about how I need to take it seriously, about how important school is, and about how missing class too much could lead to dropping out.  He then drove me to school in time for me to not miss my classes, but before he did, he gave me tons of motivational speeches, apologized for his outbursts and explained the reason why it made him so mad which I won't explain but is entirely reasonable I assure you.  I actually blush that he cared so much about my future and I am not offended or scared of him for yelling at me .

When I used to think of landlords, I used to think of angry old men and grandmas who get angry over noise and serve evictions for everything, but my landlord is just a plain good man."

"My students reminded me why I love my job. My graduating class is off to write their board exams and so yesterday they gifted me a huge card with individual messages (kind of like a yearbook, I suppose) full of the most affirming and heartwarming stuff I've ever read.

My favourite lines:


> You inspire me to explore new things, regardless of whether I'm good or bad at them, and you will forever remain an inspiration for me.

> You have always trusted me so much...I really didn't know we could do it on our own.

> I admire how you teach us with so much passion towards each story or poem and the depth with which we analyse them in class; that really helped me develop a liking towards English literature.

> I've felt free to express myself, which is something I struggle with in other classes. Your support has motivated me to do my best.

> Thank you for helping me find joy in the subject.

> I always look forward to your classes. They easily make for one of the best classes of my day.

> Your bold personality, open-mindedness and try [sic] and understand all perspectives, and self-confidence have been areas from which I have learned and implemented in my life.

> Ma'am your passion for English is contagious!

> I'm sure that if I ever seen reading comprehensions in the future I will remember the fun yet macabre passages you gave us through high school.

[Plus a few more possibly identifying notes about ""I remember when you did X"" which I shall not share...]

It's such a clich√© to be a teacher and talk about how appreciation from the children will keep you going even if everything else is a chore and a pain but my goodness this was such a boost at a terrible time in the world. üò≠

[There were also four or five with clearly repeated phrases strategically placed far away from each other on the card and that gave me a good chuckle, lol. You cannot be the shining beacon in everyone's life!]

We‚Äôre often caught up in showing love to others, but how about a little self-love this year? Treat yourself like you‚Äôre the person you‚Äôve always wanted to date. Spoil yourself, send yourself a sweet message, watch your favorite movie with a tub of ice cream, and maybe even get yourself a cute little gift. You deserve it! üíï

"It all feels so easy after today and I think I am finally finding purpose I talked with many different people today and I am finding desire to continue living.

I was fully expecting today to be crap because of how it started with me not even wanting to get out of bed but I still somehow came to school, went the first two lessons then went to my mentors fully prepared on going home but one of them sat me down while the others left and it started with some bull-crap she was talking about but then I somehow stayed till after lunch because we ran into the school psychologist in the hall and she told me to see her after next lesson and I did. We talked about a bunch of stuff and I might be starting antidepressants after we talk some more!! I have met so many doctors before her but I really think she might be the best one. Now, it‚Äôs almost night and my chest literally feels light. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve gotten hope again. My mother even spoke about it she asked if I wanted to take antidepressants and I obviously said yes. Anything to make the episodes go away. Now, we are searching for a clinic to go to after next week when I‚Äôve done a few tests. 

I am seriously so relieved to finally get somewhere with this diagnosis.

Someone among you might say ‚Äúthey are not depressed just fishing for attention‚Äù well fuck you too then lmao.
This is a summary of what happened today and I only put in the good parts, none of you know what I‚Äôve gone through. But seriously, I do feel so much better than from what I did by the start of today and I‚Äôm actually feeling wellness, which I‚Äôve literally thought was impossible for so long‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π"

"Cooked for the first time in almost two weeks! When I cook I know I'm getting better. I'm proud of myself! I have depression and when I'm depressed I don't cook and I don't get out of bed. Then on top of being depressed, I caught the flu and was miserable. Then I got the IUD birth control placed and was in pain for two days. But today I cooked for my husband and me. 

I am insanely grateful for my husband and his care and patients with me. Best husband ever! I am happy because cooking means my depression is lifting. Yay! I just wanted to share how happy I am about it."
"Finally can pay the bills again after 2 years of hardship. My husband and I have been struggling with bills since 2023, when our job cut hours and we had to draw unemployment. Same thing happened last year and he even got laid off. Every time our check would hit our account we were -$500 or even -$700 on our account. We couldn't stay afloat and it was really hard on our marriage, happiness and goals in life.

Unexpectedly, on a froday night at 8:00pm, our new job afforded for people to go out of state. Our sister plant needed some help for a month or two. We agreed and both got picked to go. We have been here now two weeks and we are getting paid Friday. I'm so happy to say, while we are up here, our checks are more than double of what we make at home. Come Friday, we will finally be done with overdrafting our checking account. No more late fees on bills. Just finally can breathe again.

"I‚Äôve been feeling really happy about being with my boyfriend, so I wanted to share it with someone :> Hello! So I‚Äôm 20F and my boyfriend (I won‚Äôt say his real name) is 21 M, we have been dating for almost 6 months now (our anniversary is on the 23rd!!) and he is the light of my life. I‚Äôve been through cheaters, manipulators, every bad thing in the book in my life and I just wanted to make a post of how grateful I am for him, he will probably never see this but just in case anyone wanted to read about what a good and healthy relationship truly is, this is the post for you. 
A little background on me, I have had very bad BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) since I was a child due to childhood issues and I‚Äôve never met anyone who was willing to deal with it or even try to truly understand. 
He‚Äôs put it so much work to help me through it all, has never judged me or said anything was too much for him. He‚Äôs been patient with me, gentle, kind, everything I could ask for. 
I‚Äôm trying to make a career out of my poems, I haven‚Äôt told him this but I‚Äôve shown him some poems and he always tears up at them, tells me on a random day how he re read some of them and how he always thinks of my voice when he reads them. 
He doesn‚Äôt even jokingly flirt with anyone, my best friend in the world always calls him his husband and my boyfriend always says ‚Äúno I‚Äôm not, i only belong to (me)‚Äù and we all laugh. 
When we went out drinking, my friends and me were all giving each other lipstick stains on our hands for fun and my roommate gave him one on his hand, he instantly rubbed it off but kept all of mine even if they were all smudged and ugly. 

I tend to forget to eat, which causes me to get irritated easily so he always makes jokes how he‚Äôs going to keep a bar or some sort of small food for me at all times just in case, he keeps saying he‚Äôll keep snickers bars (I‚Äôm allergic to nuts) and we laugh together. 
He always says how he loves the food where I‚Äôm from, I was born and raised in Mexico but I‚Äôm around 70% Arab and he always wants to eat food from Lebanon and Mexican food because he wants to learn more about both my cultures, we‚Äôre partially long distance so when he‚Äôs back to his home he tells me he made some tacos and how it always makes him think of my smile when I eat some good food.
He always says how he wants to cook for me, how he‚Äôll bring breakfast into my bed when we live together, how he wants to try all the things I bake in the future and so much more. 
His family is absolutely wonderful as well, his father is the sweetest guy, his mother is such a fun gal to be with and his sister is so sweet and always seems to be happy about something just like him. 

We‚Äôve had issues in the past about me thinking into things too much and making problems in my own head, he always sits me down immediately and lets me talk it out, he tells me what he‚Äôs thinking and we come to a understanding in both sides, it sounds so simple and silly but I‚Äôve grown up with parents who only yelled and ignored any problems I tried to talk out so it‚Äôs very hard for me to voice concerns I have about some things. 

This post might be silly but I honestly just wanted to tell someone about all of this, my friends are all fed up with me talking about him all the time hahaha

**Sorry if the grammar in this post is all over the place, my English isn‚Äôt great**

He truly is my best friend, and the love of my life. So even if he will never see this, I wanted to thank him, and show all of you that love is such a wonderful thing, even if it isn‚Äôt a partner, maybe something as simple as love for a specific smell in the morning, a plushy you‚Äôve had since you were little, a friend, heck even self love is such a beautiful thing. 
Good luck to whoever is reading this, I hope your day is going amazing and I hope the rest of your week is just as great! "
"A song i made reached 10 million streams on Spotify. As a self-taught, working from the bedroom and fully independent i have no words for this and i am unbelievable happy! Never give up a dream! "
I found this on Instagram. Thought this belongs here. 
"I want to have an interesting conversation with anyone about anything. So, Who's game? I'm just bored looking for some fun or very deep conversation. Let's start something. "
I finally got the opportunity to upvote something to make it 1000 
"09/02/25 - Posting daily updates on what made me happy - My daughter went to a festival with her best friend, she took way too long to put together the most perfect outfit.
- Spent the day with my gorgeous wife, we dropped my daughter and her friend off at the festival, we went and watched Cirque de Soleil which blew me away and we had overpriced burgers at a trendy burger joint.
- We played UNO No Mercy with our son and got smashed!"
"My husband is a success ‚Äúagain‚Äù! Again in quotes, because he‚Äôs *always* been a success in my eyes. Our household is in week #2 of someone being ill (or is it more like 3 weeks now? I can‚Äôt remember. Days & weeks have lost all sense of time)‚Ä¶ the house itself is in dire need of cleaning & catching up‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôve never been happier!!!

So many great things are happening that far eclipse any negatives. We just got our oldest daughter (‚ÄúGwen, 17‚Äù) a car. Even though it was a 2.5 hour drive to get it (totally worth it, as it was a wonderful deal and a really great car for Gwen!). My parents have been so amazing in helping with the littles (‚ÄúAviva‚Äù, 7 and ‚ÄúBuzz‚Äù, 4 ‚Äî they helped us out when I‚Äôve been sick + we retrieved Gwen‚Äôs car), and they‚Äôre even talking about retiring in a couple years! I love my job. And my husband‚Äôs business is thriving. **His** company! (Gosh, that still feels amazing to say aloud!) 

This road has not been easy, but today I can confidently say it‚Äôs worth it. Just a small glimpse into what it took to get here though:

My husband (‚ÄúJoe‚Äù) began working for an entrepreneurial company a little more than 2 years ago. He left a stable, guaranteed, really nice income (one that allowed me to be a SAHM) to have a chance for an ownership stake in this new company. I was fully supportive of this opportunity, for infinite reasons. But the biggest reason was because I knew that if Joe didn‚Äôt take this chance, he would always look back and wonder ‚Äúwhat could have been?‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt confident in the company itself, per se; I wasn‚Äôt **un**confident in it either. But I was sure of Joe and his abilities & resourcefulness. I knew that whatever came of this venture, it would lead to greater things. 

2023 was one of the hardest career-years that Joe ever experienced. He also lost his dad that year, which was so sad. That was also the year that Buzz turned 2. Terrible doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe that kiddo‚Äôs year! (Mostly kidding, I love that strong-willed, handsome little Joe-mini-me!)

Anyway, back to the work aspect. Imagine selling something that sounds ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù ‚Äî nobody‚Äôs gonna bite on that fake bait, right?! That‚Äôs how Joe felt all too often that year. He has always been hugely successful in his outside B2B sales roles, so this really screwed with his head. Luckily Joe has made major headway in that company since then. I also went back to work full time in fall, 2023 (at a wonderful place with **great** benefits). And Joe gained even more success once he decided to create his own company in late 2023. 

I had been encouraging Joe to do his ‚Äúown thing‚Äù for a long time, and for [very logical] reasons, he was always reluctant. But after I went to work full time, many of those reasons went out the window. We spitballed a lot ideas, and the more we talked about it the more feasible & real it became. I told him, if nothing else, just go ahead and create your LLC so you‚Äôre ready if an opportunity ever presents itself. 

By March of 2024, that‚Äôs exactly what happened. And by the end of last year, Joe & I were in a really good place financially. Very close to where his income was back in 2022 ‚Äî except now he *owns* his own company! 

Actually the company is no longer an LLC; Joe‚Äôs company is now an S-Corp. Our accountant advised us that this is the best fiscal choice for our fam. Gwen is even planning on joining Joe on a work-trip later this year, so maybe she‚Äôll become an official employee at some point. Oh yeah, Gwen graduated high school a semester early! Anyway, so many wonderful things happening!

I cannot wait to see the amazing things I‚Äôm sure Joe will accomplish this year! I am SO freaking proud of this man!!!!!"
"Ya know, I came here specifically because I had a REALLY happy thought that I wanted to share. As a man of culture amongst my people of all walks of life, womankind, genuinely, truly, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for giving us the voice of my dude Goku in Japan. I don‚Äôt think we would‚Äôve got what we got in America if not for her. Preciate it :)"
"I finished my first week at my new job and I couldn't be happier I had been job searching for 6 months and had put in 18 applications with one specific company, and I finally landed (on my VERY LAST application, before I had decided I was going to take a break from job searching) what is essentially my dream job.

It's in a department that fits my education and interests, and my position specifically is *perfect* for someone with my skillset who's just starting out.

It pays the rate I wanted when I first started searching that I had slowly given up on over a few months of rejections.

My team is amazing. Just comparing to my last job, not only am I not the only cat person on my team, I'm not even the only person with a black cat. I'm not the only person with a nose ring. I'm not the only vegan.

Everyone has been incredibly warm and welcoming. I had a 25 minute conversation with my boss about our favorite true crime podcasts, documentaries, and financial scandals. I had a conversation with another coworker about the satire and feminism behind Pride and Prejudice. 

I don't feel ostracized as an ""alt"" girlie (visible tattoos, facial piercings, and vivid hair) in the corporate world which is absolutely mind boggling. 

And I already know a couple of people who work in other departments, so I'm making a ton of connections.

I found my place. I can already tell that I'm going to be valued and recognized for my work ethic and rewarded for my progress. And it's amazing."

"My acne is finally disappearing after 3 years of trying to get rid of it. After dropping out of the self care part of my life from 13 up until last year, I was majorly depressed. I had horrible acne, I had a Pepsi addiction (which lead to cavities bc I never brushed my teeth) ND it was insane.

But just recently, I have a set routine to take care of myself, wash my face, brush my teeth, take care of myself. And my ACNE IS ALMOST COMPLETELY GONE!! after about like 7 months of washing it and applying the new topical my doctor recommended about maybe a month ago?? It's helped so much!! "

"Three self editing tips that bring me fulfilment and happiness *Austin Kleon*‚Äôs book¬†*Share Your Work!*¬†*Austin Kleon*‚Äôs book¬†*Share Your Work!*¬†inspired me to start this blog. In a recent video, he said that he has a first draft of a new book. Before sharing his writing with anyone, he applies three self-editing techniques.

# 1. Give it time

>Time is a writer‚Äôs best friend. The work improves by being set aside and re-approached with fresh eyes. -¬†*George Saunders*

*Austin*¬†*Kleon*¬†suggests,¬†*You need to let it sit for at least a day. Put it in the drawer and go out the door and come back to look at it with fresh eyes.*

I keep multiple posts in different stages of drafting, allowing me to revisit them with a fresh perspective. This process helps refine my ideas and introduce new angles.

# 2. Print it out

>To write is human, to edit is divine. -¬†*Stephen King*

Printing out a draft text and editing with a pencil in hand can be incredibly helpful. The goal is to create distance from the work you‚Äôve poured so much effort into. You want to make it feel unfamiliar (almost as if someone else wrote it) so you can critique it with fresh eyes and make meaningful improvements.

When I was office based, I printed out many documents because I found hard copies easier to edit. While I miss that convenience, I know the environment is better off for it.

# 3. Read aloud

>If you force yourself to read your writing aloud, you will hear things you missed on the silent page - repetitions, clumsy phrases, clich√©s and a general lack of rhythm. -¬†*William Zinsser*

*Austin*¬†*Kleon*¬†recounts,¬†*Something I learned when I did an audiobook for the first time. Everyone should do the audiobook before they put the book out because when you have to read the text, you realise how bad it is. So one of the hacks I do is put on headphones and pull up the manuscript and read it like I would read it to an audiobook.*

In a similar vein, I read my blog post aloud and make amendments if the text does not flow. Then I record myself.

Childhood dream of doing an Ollie has been completed. I‚Äôve always wanted to learn to skate. I‚Äôve never been able to get over my fear of slipping on one. Recently I found a longboard sitting by the dumpsters and I tried riding that. Something about the big wheels made me feel a lot more confident. A few days ago I got my skateboard out from storage and I‚Äôve been working at it each day. Today something clicked. Next goal is a kickflip once I can get some more height.

"I'm not the best writer, and this is super sappy... you've been warned. I'm constantly worried about my whole life crashing... mostly due to not having the money to pay for things or losing someone special to me... but right now, in this very moment... I'm having one of those times... where you're in that moment for just a second longer... grateful for your life.... grateful for the life you built... and proud of every damn decision you've ever made to get HERE.... in your room, that you share with no one else... your own little oasis, that blocks you from that crazy outside place. I'm grateful to live in the city, have a job that pays me what I deserve, and the opportunity to make more if I really tried.. grateful for that little car outside that gets me to work and and back each day.. for the angels in heaven that make sure i do just that... listening to the rain and watching  my favorite comfort show for the millionth time... grateful for the family I was born in, the incredible friends that always have my back, and the men that make my heart flutter. Grateful that through all of the terrible decisions I make on the daily and have made in the past, it got me to where I am today. I have never been so truly happy and incredibly anxiety ridden in my entire life, and I love it. So if you're reading this and your wondering what show I'm watching.. or what city i live in... just know... that life is always worth living, and if you feel any differently about that, do ur best each and every day to get where you want to be... because if you ever get there and have the chance to be this lucky, thank the ones who sacrificed for you to be here. I think about my abuelo and the trauma he must of endured at a young age, despite ALL OF THAT he managed to take care of my grandmother and all their babies, and build a strong unit, a solid family. Who are always there for each other, never fight, always laugh and take care of each other... I thank the universe and God or whatever good thing i did in my last life...for my grandparents...and my parents... who immigrated to this country...to provide a ""better"" life for me.... because they did everything in their power to make sure that their future generations life was better than their own... I'm grateful for each and every human in this world who has love for me.... because in one way or another... they have made an impact on my life... and made me the sweet, caring, stubborn son of a bitch that u see before you. I end this by saying... cheers... from one scared...lost... 30 something soul... Thank you for reading my nonsense, and i hope that you feel this way often in your own lifetime. "

"Returned to high-school, Pre adulting happiness this week Since adulting, I have not had time to indulge in the things that used to bring me joy. I'm very happy today because I realized everyday this week, I got to do my hair and skincare, I drank tea and read 600-800 pages of a book. I haven't been able to enjoy this since high-school more than 10 years ago. 

I'm just really happy and wanted to share that. "

But I‚Äôm also happy to be alive every day so I think that makes a difference. I just hope others are truly happy also and I‚Äôm glad I found a thread where people talk about being happy."
"I see you! You matter! When I feel the happiness in your post, it makes me happy, too. Sometimes I find myself mindlessly scrolling.

But, I feel his joy, and I need to do a better job of sharing in that happiness. All of you, I love your happy posts. I guess maybe I‚Äôll try to upvote or comment more to you. Your happiness really does rub off on me, too. So thank you for sharing. "

"I got to see Notre-Dame Basilica of Montreal‚Ä¶ Didn‚Äôt know I would be capable of    
travelling again due to medical issues‚Ä¶but ended up going to Ottawa then Montreal for a short mini-trip with a friend.

Had the opportunity to stand inside, both me and my friend felt called to step inside. It was a beautiful experience. So much peaceful, strong, and positive energy. Almost as beautiful as Notre-Dame and Sacr√©-Coeur in Paris, France that I got to visit in 2009. 

Montrealers, I absolutely love, love, and love your city! It is so beautiful and everyone welcomed us with open arms. Everyone was so friendly and happy. It was freezing cold, seriously it felt like -30 but it didn‚Äôt bother us. I absolutely love everyone speaking French and everything from the signs to stores being French! I can‚Äôt wait to visit you all again. Ottawa you were also cool! I am now at home recovering from a fever. It felt amazing to be able to travel again!

"I hit 100k monthly listeners on Spotify as a self-taught musician and fully independent artist!! Most people thought I was delusional when I first started...and I honestly oubted myself many times too..but I'm super glad I never gave up! 2.5 years ago I had decided I didn't want to work a 9-5 for the rest of my life. So I knew I had to do something about it. I always had tons of musical ideas running through my head and could already play piano so I decided I would try to give the music thing a shot...and hopefully one day be able to make a full time income from it. 

Almost everyone thought I was delusional, and it kind of hurt quite a bit...And I know realistically it kind of is. Because statistically speaking most musicians never see money from their art. But I had to at least try and give it my best...And I'm so glad I never gave up!!! I now make quite a decent part time income from my music now. And getting closer than ever to one day being able to support myself full time doing something I love and :')

Never give up if you truly want something~

"I had a really nice moment at the gym tonight For all the issues of gym culture, I do really appreciate the general feeling of support and encouragement. I was bench pressing, and by my 3rd set of 75lbs my arms were hurting, but I wanted to keep going. So I just asked the guy on the bench next to me to spot me, and he did, no problem. Told me to ask again if I needed more help, which I did again when I went up 5 lbs for my last set. He was super nice, didn‚Äôt have his hands on the bar the whole time (so I felt like I was still doing the work), and it just made me happy. 

I love when little things like this remind me that people are still good. "

After lunch I was informed that I have been promoted and will be receiving a raise. (I haven't been with this place long, and this is what I was hoping for.) Upon arriving home i find a German chocolate cake, two birthday cards and wrapped presents (from her son, who remembered my favorite chocolates and wrote me a sweet card.)
All that followed by a nice soak in the hot tub and a footrub.
 Happy doesn't really cut it. 
Enjoy what you have. I sure as hell plan too. "

After the music stopped, I had to pull over because we were both laughing so hard. I wish all days were filled with that much joy and happiness <3

Good day everyone!"
"I am so happy and content with how my life is going! Spreading Joy & Love to all! I‚Äôve struggled with my mental health most of my life due to a very rough upbringing and various bad choices Ive made throughout my life.

But for the first time in ever? I just feel so happy and content with every single thing in my life.

- I have a lovely and supportive friend group.
- My physical and mental health is the best it has ever been.
- I‚Äôve landed my dream job and have been enjoying every second of it for more than a month.
- My living/home situation is great with sharing a lovely flat in my dream city with friends.
- And one more very silly reason which kinda made me write this - I can enjoy weed again!

I used to really enjoy smoking for relaxation (never have abused it), until the feelings I got from THC pulled a full 180 and instead of relaxing I would just get horrible anxiety.

This lasted for almost 4 years and each year I would give it 1 chance to see if I still hate it - I did every time. 

Except now - did some lovely peach candy edibles and it just made me so happy and reflective on how good things are.

Spreading joy and love to you all!

"15,000 days of complete sobriety today. Very happy today despite hardship, challenges, anger, tears, love and smiles, toxic relationships, ending families and starting new ones. Pain, happiness, deaths and births, jobs, retirement, all of it.  I never gave up, never quit swinging. Big things are possible with small efforts put together, one day at a time."
"Gasp. So aside from family and friends and my lovely Reddit Fam, what I love most is the beach in the winter, maybe even more than summer. "

"I‚Äôm finally feeling appreciate at work, there is hope! After over a year and half at my job, I finally have the opportunity to get promoted. I live in Pa, but have been given the chance for a major promotion and to move to a new state. I‚Äôll be going from a normal inventory person to either a manager at a new store or even an assistant general manager (2nd highest position). I‚Äôve been working my ass off for months and my general manager wants me to go with him to a new state to lead others. It might not seem like much, but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been working for, for months. Plus, I can start my life over with my partner. I‚Äôm beyond scared of this, but I‚Äôm way more excited. It gives me hope that life has more to offer than what I‚Äôve been going through. It teaches me to work through the hard parts, and keep looking up!

UPDATE: Turns out I most likely won‚Äôt be able to move away and get the promotion I‚Äôve wanted. The timeframe is too short and I just can‚Äôt afford it. I feel so heartbroken over this. I‚Äôm over working myself to prove I deserve this, but that doesn‚Äôt even matter. It feels like nothing matters. I don‚Äôt want to start over at a new job, but I can‚Äôt stay here if I don‚Äôt have a future. Hopefully I get better news, but right now I just feel depressed and empty. "

"Got accepted into university ‚Ä¶.. at almost 50. üòÖ My life has taken so many twists and turns. But recently I‚Äôve been seeing my daughter applying and getting accepted into different universities. So I decided to apply for my degree that I almost finished once. 

Let me go back. I was working what felt like a dead-end job for my dad. My daughter was born and I couldn‚Äôt see myself doing what I was doing with her in my life. With help from my wife I applied to university in my early 30s. Almost towards the end of my dual degree in computer engineering and electrical engineering. I was offered an internship with Intel in Oregon. A one year internship turned into seven wonderful years. Before my father offered to actually pay me to work for him. lol. So came back to work for him and eventually myself. 

Now I regret not finishing those degrees. And seeing my daughter apply for university got me thinking that it‚Äôs not too late to finish what I started.

I might get confused as the professor on the first day, but I‚Äôm so excited. So happy to have applied and gotten accepted again.

I‚Äôm hoping in a year I‚Äôll post about my graduation. ü§ûüèΩ"
"Reminder I wrote to myself to always keep in mind I am in control of my own happiness. At this point you need to remember, talking, vocalizing your fears, wants, needs, feelings, heartaches, begging, and pleading, has not helped. 
It is out of your hands. 
You cannot change him or his feelings towards you. His outlook on life. 
You have been grieving the future you thought you‚Äôd have together. 
Hope springs eternal, you restart the clock. The clock will not wait for you. You only have one life. But you have so much love to give. 
You need to start with loving yourself. Wholly. You deserve true love. Respect. Intimacy. Reciprocation. A partner. 
Until then, you must be a partner to yourself. You, and only you. Give yourself grace. Focus on your goals and your needs. 
In the beginning, you‚Äôll just need to make it through each day. 
You know you can do this. It just hurts so badly because you love him so much, you thought he was the one, you thought you‚Äôd found your best friend, your partner in life, your soulmate, your family. You thought you‚Äôd celebrate your bonds. You thought you‚Äôd start a family of your own. This does not make you stupid or weak. This means you had hope when none could be seen, you saw light in the darkness, you saw a kindred spirit. It means you have love to give, you see the good in people. You want a  better life, a better world. You can still be a part of these things. You must let go of the frustration, the what-ifs, the whys. He will not answer you. You may never receive closure. But you must keep living. Not surviving, not scraping by, not dragging around a husk of who you used to be. You must live. For you."

"I know it‚Äôs not a lot, but Im happy that i Modded a game without help. I know it‚Äôs not much, but man, I‚Äôm really proud of myself for modding a game‚Äîespecially because I know almost nothing about computers. Like, if you asked me to install Word on your PC, I wouldn‚Äôt know how to do it. If you asked me to download Firefox, I‚Äôd probably just reset the whole thing.

I‚Äôve always loved playing on consoles, and when it comes to PC gaming, I usually ask my cousin for help. But he tends to be really mean about it, so I decided to give it a shot on my own. It took quite some time, but I did it, and I‚Äôm very proud of myself‚Äîwhich is something I haven‚Äôt felt or said in a long time.

You‚Äôd think that someone who works at a GPS company would know about this stuff, but nope, haha. Still, this has inspired me to maybe learn more about computers‚Äîand hopefully not blow mine up in the process, haha.

This is my first post on Reddit ever, and also not a native speaker, so I apologize if I made a mistake."

"It took some time but I found my true happiness... I was 47 when I met a colleague who would later become a friend and within 5 years my best friend, partner, and as of just two months ago, my wife. I was not an unhappy person by any means but it's been through her friendship and partnership that I've found my true self and realized real inner happiness. 

My appreciation for the impact our relationship has had on the way I see myself, my business, my children, my parents, and interact with countless others is something I'll always be proud of.

I wasn't missing anything without her. But I'm so much better with her in my life.

It's a wonderful adventure of self discovery and partnership. And I try every day not to fuck it up."
This might be the best thing thats ever happened to me

"My wife and I are High School sweethearts! Here‚Äôs some photos over the last decade! I wanted to post something happy somewhere just because I‚Äôm pretty stoked!

My wife is my best friend, and we have been together since high school. We have been really intentional with setting our hearts and souls towards personal development and have seen so many blessings come our way. 

We paid off our debts this year, both got promotions, and because of this we are finally able to purchase our first home!

Photo dump was funny because we are actually looking for pictures to get framed and the photos we‚Äôve had after knowing each other so long is crazy! 

I don‚Äôt know if you have ever looked at pictures of you 10 years ago, but I feel like we were babies!

Here‚Äôs some photos of us through the years, made my heart warm and wanted to share!"
"I (37Dad) just spoke with my daughter (13yr) for 45 minutes after a year of barely any words! I just needed to express the joy I feel right now. After my divorce, my daughter leaned heavily on her mother (a narcissist) and drove her away. After some successful dad jokes otlver the months, she asked if I could call her. 

She had so much to say! She was my ride or die while she grew up, and man did i miss talking to her. Almost a year without more than a few words in person. I'm so fucking happy!"

"I am very happy after my date playfully manhandled me Idk if this is even the right sub, but I need to say this to someone that's not family or friends.

I am 21 and new to dating. I've been exploring the apps and things have mostly been casual with all my encounters and I am okay with that. Met with a match for the second time and we're chilling and having some wine and watching a movie wtv wtv. We're cuddling and he puts me in a wresling neck lock (playfully of course) and we're talking about stuff and idk somehow we're at one point standing and he just lifts me by the waist and sits me on his shoulder. I am 5'4"" and 135 pounds and i know that sounds like good stats but ive always been a bit flabby kinda curvy ig? This just made me feel very very cutesy and dainty its the most I'd laughed in a while. He's a wrestling trainer and wrestler himself and it just shocks me how strong boys can be. There were also a couple times he just scooped me up and tossed me on the bed and I realized how happy getting manhandled can make me. I want to tell him this but idk I dont want to seem soo overtly about it. I do remember genuinely complimenting him a lot throughout the night about how strong he is. And yeah I am very happy after last night."

"A tad silly, but I got my own sewing machine, the exact same as my moms. Technically I got this in November, but I was sick for two weeks and had never opened it, until now.

My mom used to sew 95% of the clothes I owned and I had even began sewing my own clothes with her machine. I looked online for the brand, just to see when it was made when I found it for an AMAZING price. About 120, with 50 dollar shipping, so 170 in total!!!

My mom and the old sewing machine are still around so it seems a bit silly to get so happy over this but I am, lol.

"Finally found time to put away all the holiday decorations Putting away the Christmas ornaments always brings back so many memories. Each one has its own story, whether it‚Äôs a childhood craft or a souvenir from a family trip. As I pack them up, I can‚Äôt help but think of all those happy little holiday moments. Some of the ornaments are a bit worn now, but they still feel special, and I know they‚Äôll bring that same cozy nostalgia when I pull them out again next season."

"Hey, want to make friends with people who are working towards making their life better. Basically if you are doing a job, earning and exploring to balance life, taking care of yourself and enjoying and you feel like to have someone whom you can share these with . So, I have been doing healing and self love. But I feel to have someone to talk to. 
So I thought are there some other people like me , who wanna talk on call or chat and tell about how they are doing in their life. 
I do have a criteria to people whom I would like to connect with -
Some in age group 23-26. Who are doing MBA right now, or have started working in a job.

This is a similar profile to mine, so I hope I will be better able to connect with you.

Be it your challenge in college or office, or how well you are taking care of yourself, I am looking forward to talk to a person,  pr you cooked something nice for you today
 
In short, who is putting efforts to make their life better and wish to have someone positive to talk to.  "
"My most difficult client at work is going elsewhere This is a huge deal and big win for me because my client is going to another mental health clinic and I can finally breathe a little easier. I work in a mental health outpatient clinic and I‚Äôm a case manager. My client literally made me cry so hard at work because I got yelled at. I mean REALLY yelled at to the point where my program director had to step in and kick her out. 

This client is bipolar and wasn‚Äôt compliant with meds and she really wasn‚Äôt working on treatment goals with me either. "

"Things that bring me joy and hopefully won't have a bot remove my post (Because despite positivity and happiness, the bot deleted my post bc it had too short a title) 

You know when bus drivers do that little wave when they pass each other? I've stayed sitting in the front seats of the bus just to see it. It just makes me giddy somehow. 

Also I've really gotten back into Minecraft lately, and when I make my farms I always make sure to give the sheep a lot of water space. Because watching them jump around in the water might just be the most delightful thing I've ever seen. 

Also the movies Grease, Cider House Rules, Me, Myself and Irene and Tuck Everlasting kept me alive when I was in a mental hospital for 3 weeks when I was 19. 

And the songs The World Ain't Slowin Down by Ellis Paul, Wild Bird by Bigbang, Can't Find The Time To Tell You by Hootie & The Blowfish (Idk why they get so much hate??) are so good and happy. "

"Guys I'm so excited and hopeful right now about this girl TLDR; I reconnected a while ago with a crush from all the way back in second grade and I just want to scream from the rooftops how happy I am. 

I've been struggling for a long time with relationships and I've all but given up. I've been incredibly lonely as I live alone over a thousand miles from any family. BUT! I reconnected with this girl I met way back in the second grade and who I've probably been crushing on just as long. She's made it very clear she's into me as well and I'm over the moon! 

The only thing I'm praying for is for nothing to go wrong because she just finalized a divorce about a week or so ago which is awful, and I'm hoping this isn't just a rebound for her and it's actually something real. But regardless of all that, the fact that we are talking is enough for me. 

It's been a long time since I've felt this strongly about someone and it just completely warms me up, I wish all of you can feel this level of happiness at some point in your lives."

"Life Center (Livingston, NJ) field trip experience. For the first field trip my Sophomore HS year special education class had was for this place called Life Center, where it is an indoor simulator for autistic children to explore what life is like outside of school. I have ADHD. There is a ShopRite, with snacks, a book store, a mini theater, grooming pet center and more. I first decided to ride a bike around this paper course with 2 crossing guard surrounding the little path around the indoor town. If was sort of fun. I then got a doctor‚Äôs appointment at a place with 4 doctors checking my heart rate and if it was a good boy or not. I should also tell that my female school aid was around me all the time. A little boy came up to me and told me to move while I was in the book store, it was kind of whatever, I laughed. I saw iced coffee there and did not drink it because it would keep me up, big boys need to sleep. I saw my female cerebral palsy friend come over to me and I hugged her, while we headed into the mini theater with popcorn along with some of the younger kids in our class. They played Discovery Kids, haha. When we were done, I headed over to the dog grooming section, the dogs there were so cute. There was this Siberian Husky that came up to me and started licking my tummy and I giggled. I went to go pet the Golden Retriever at the back, but it but me on instinct, it kind of hurt but I was okay. After all the fun, we finally went back to the school. We said our goodbyes and thank you‚Äôs and we left to go to the school.

It was very, fun and I recommend going there if you like to and you are in New Jersey. Thank you for taking the time to read this if you did."

"I was so nervous for my boyfriend to come home to the mess I made today‚Ä¶ I was so nervous for my boyfriend to come home to the mess I made today‚Ä¶ 

My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 7 months, and we live together in a beautiful house full of unique art and trinkets. I stopped working a few months ago, as I was losing more money on gas going to work than I was making, and I was stressed and never had the time or energy to do the art projects I love. He makes decent money to support the two of us and his house is paid off, so he offered to support me while I wait for school to start and figure out the next step. 

I usually keep the house clean and organized while he‚Äôs at work, since I get bored easily and love having an organized and appealing house to spend my time in, and when he gets home we can spend time together instead of worrying about the state of the house. 

Today, however, I went full manic art project mode. The porch had epoxy resin projects everywhere, the living room had paints and canvases and random pieces of wood and gold foil leaf pieces and glitter scattered about. In my head I planned on finishing my projects and cleaning up by the time he came home, but I got lost in the creations, and before I knew it, he walked through the front door. 

I‚Äôve been in some pretty rough relationships in the past, where I modify my life and actions to fit their happiness, and constantly worry about pleasing them instead of spending my time fulfilling my own needs. Because of this, I had a mini heart attack, thinking he was going to yell or act annoyed or disappointed in me for spending all day goofing off instead of cleaning or being productive. 

Instead, he grabbed me and hugged me and said ‚ÄúThis is the most beautiful messy scene I could have ever walked into.‚Äù I asked him what he meant by that, not believing he wasn‚Äôt upset at first. He then explained that the whole point of him offering to take care of things if I decided to take advantage of our financial situation and quit my job was because he knew I have so much creative passion, but no time or energy to pursue any of it. He told me that seeing me do things that make me fulfilled creatively is worth any amount of mess that can always be cleaned up. 

It‚Äôs not a huge deal, or big amazing story, but man‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm not used to having someone who genuinely cares about my ambitions and not just what I contribute financially or to the household. I‚Äôve never had a relationship where my partner actually cares that I contribute to my own free spirit as well. 

I‚Äôm just really fucking happy. "
"I relish in happy, fulfilled feelings because they aren't very common for me. But I adopted 3 mice and built them this lovely home and I wanted to share it because it makes me happy to sit here and watch them enjoy it.  "

"I‚Äôm finally free from my father, I turned 18 today! Today I turned 18. A huge birthday and it‚Äôs been one hell or a ride my whole life. Since I‚Äôm now legally an adult, I can finally cut off contact with my father. My inner child is free knowing she won‚Äôt have to deal with the pain and manipulation he put on me. I‚Äôm celebrating my step towards adulthood and severely in my mind, my freedom. I‚Äôm not obligated to do calls all the time and put on my happy face knowing what he‚Äôs done to my mom and my family for literally my whole life. This weight is off my chest and I just wanted to type it out and share, that no matter how hard it may seem to deal with an abusive parent, you can make it out. And life WILL be better. It‚Äôs already changed for me so much and I‚Äôm so happy. My mom is my ride or die and I‚Äôm so grateful for her help for everything I‚Äôve been through. :,)"
"My mom met my bestfriend for the first time. I'm a highschool student & yesterday, I attended an Academic Achievements award ceremony I was invited to with my mom & my bestfriend (who I snuck in as my sister).

I had a pretty long, work day after which I was to directly attend the ceremony & I was so tired & hungry so, I asked my bestfriend to bring chewing gum for me. She showed up with pasta & a sandwich her mom had made along with a breath spray too. I had initially asked for a chewing gum mainly because I kind of have this weird phobia of my breath being unpleasant if I haven't brushed my teeth in a couple of hours, she doesn't know this. The fact that she showed up with all 3 of these things truly is the most thoughtful thing a friend has ever done for me. 

At the ceremony, they separated the students & their families so, my mum & bestfriend sat together & planned to chant my name when I would appear on stage to collect my award.
When I was in line to go on stage, they both kept filming me with the widest smile on their face: it was like the 'proud mom meme' but I couldn't tell who the actual proud mom was. Even in the car ride there, we three kept laughing the entire time.

After the ceremony, we ate these amazing fries together while I told my mom some crazy friendship drama another one of my friends at school was going through. We then headed for dinner & we were pretty much laughing the entire time. 

I know this all might not sound all that special like the other stories on here but I still wanted to share it. This was one of those evenings of my life that I forever want to remember. It happened yesterday so it is all fresh in my memory but the main reason I'm posting this is because I want this to stay fresh in my memory always, I never want to forget this day. Even typing this right now kind of makes me tear right up but I truly hope everyone gets moments like this in their life where they feel so loved. 

I think if you look closely, love truly is all around. Hint: it's in the fries you eat with your mum & your bestfriend."

"When I was in the plane after leaving Lanzarote, everythings felt right and was one of my happiest moments in my life Yesterday I was thinking about one of my happiest moments. I'm just 19 years old and always wanted to explore the world. I have Asperger syndrome and I become one of the best pianists in my country, I was selected to participate in concerts in Europe.

Long story short, my happiest moment was when I was leaving Lanzarote, an isle from the Canary Islands, I was in the plane, seeing how Lanzarote becomes more and more tiny in my window and hearing music from a game called Dredge. The game it's from exploring the ocean and have a very sentimental and magic music.

So, I was leaving the Isle and seeing in my window with a little bit of nostalgia, with the food from the plane in my table and my seat near to the window and without any person near to me (I'm very shy). And for a little bit, everything had sense. That's the only travel I ever had in my life, I quit piano and now I'm learning physics and mathematics, it's another thing that I really like, but I would never forget those days, and specifically that last day in Lanzarote. Thank you for reading my post."

"Quit drinking - reconnected with old crush 2024 was by far the hardest year of my life.  I broke up with my ex of 10 years.  Used alcohol and pills to self medicate.

I quit pills 2 weeks ago.  Last Friday I had my last beer.  I feel amazing and it's only been a few days.    
  
Yesterday re-connected with an old crush who is also sober.  We hadn't talked in years.  I was always super shy...we fooled around (20 years ago) a little but never took it to the next level.  I was super nervous but I didn't want to get stuck in the friend zone so I shot my shot.  I'm driving down to see her this weekend and go on a date.  She actually said she was gonna ask me out if I didn't have the courage to do it...she's sick of guys treating her poorly and she wants to give it a shot with a good guy.  

I feel so blessed and lucky.

Last week this time I was super depressed.  Now I feel like I'm floating on cloud 9.  

Had to tell someone."

"My best friend finally contacted me again Me and her have done everything together the last year, sharing so many incredible memories. We had a huge fight at the end of December and she said she needed space away from me. Three weeks of zero contact let me rethink a lot... but also got me extremely depressed because I didn't know if she'd be in my life anymore.

Three weeks later, she texted me again! We saw each other at a group hangout and she was being cool! And now she's texting me a bit more. Things are very slowly returning to normal and I'm happy she's back in my life :)"
"I had my first interview and it went way better than I could‚Äôve anticipated! Pretty much the title. I‚Äôve been struggling with a job search, applying to jobs for two months.

"My best friend's Hen Party (bachelorette) - feeling seen and loved Hi! I put bachelorette in the title as I gather a lot of users are not from the UK where we call it a 'hen party'.

Anyway my best friend is engaged to be married this summer and I am looking forward to it immensely. I love her deeply and really like the person she's engaged to.

I messaged her to ask if she'd like me to arrange her hen party and she replied to say thank you but she just saw her sisters on the weekend and they have already started making a plan, so it's all in hand. Totally fine with me :)

What really made me happy is that the friend messaged to say an outline of what they're thinking for the event - a night or two away. Knowing that I have mobility issues (legally disabled) she suggested that some of it might not be suitable for me (hiking, wild swimming, etc) and so gave me the option of whether Id like to be put in the whatsapp group when they set it up. This means the world to me - to be seen and recognised and given choices. People very often overlook my problems and it leaves me in an awkward spot of having to explain that actually...I can't do XYZ and then have to make excuses about not coming, etc. She's just totally removed that as an issue and I am deeply relieved.

I have said that we can plan a little something just the two of us. Like a night at a nice hotel, or a fancy meal out, etc.

Anyway - this made me so happy - so I'm sharing!"

me and some of my friends are throwing a party, and we planned to sleep over at the place, tonight this (amazing) friend of mine told us she can't sleepover and has to leave early because her mom doesn't allow her (she is a really good and responsible girl) and that they fought about this, so I texted her because I tought she may need some comfort. we talked for a little while, I told her I'm sorry, that it's not her fault and that I love her. In the end she texted me ""I love you a lot, you really are a wonderful person"" and I was just like this ü•πü•π cause she is such a good caring and sweet girl and im so sad that her parents are strict. 

I also have a ""friend crush"" on her, meaning I really wanna be her friend (I mean, I already am her friend, buy I whish to be CLOSE with her) and this just melted my heart.

"What small cozy rituals do you do for yourself just because they make you happy? Hey everyone!!

I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about how we show kindness to ourselves in everyday boring life - not the big, extravagant gestures, but the small, consistent things we do just because they make us happy. For example, I buy myself flowers every Friday. I don‚Äôt tell myself I don‚Äôt need them or that they‚Äôre unnecessary. I just want them. Even when I don't have the extra money. They brighten my space and when they wilt after a few days, I throw them out and get new ones. It‚Äôs feels luxurious and grounding to me. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Do you have any small rituals or indulgences like this? Like, idk, wearing your perfume to bed?"

"To the One Who Changed My Life: A Letter to My Reddit Friend  Six months ago, on the unpredictable side of the internet, I met someone who would change my life in ways I never could have imagine. Through the simple exchange of words on Reddit, i found someone who I will forever be grateful for. 

He has this weird side that I can‚Äôt help but adore. His taste in music is nothing I‚Äôve ever encountered, sometimes so unique and unexpected that it makes me laugh, but it‚Äôs also part of what makes him, him. It‚Äôs a reflection of his quirky personality, and I wouldn‚Äôt want it any other way. 

His smile, oh his smile, is one of the most beautiful things and it always warms my heart. He‚Äôs a picky eater, but there‚Äôs something endearing about it. He knows exactly what he likes, and I can‚Äôt help but find that charming. 

And then there‚Äôs his humour, his ability to make me laugh and blush everyday makes me feel so happy.  He‚Äôs also a beautiful writer. He does it so effortlessly and every word is chosen with such care that it feels like it was meant just for me. His way of writing is often something that lingers in my mind. 

But beyond all that, he has this incredible ability to care for me and consistently show me what true love feels like. In a world that often feels lonely, he has shown me warmth, kindness, and a beautiful presence that has comforted me when I felt I was falling apart.

To my beautiful friend,  If I could give you one gift, it would be the chance to see yourself through my eyes. You‚Äôd see how incredible you are, how your kindness, humor, and understanding make the world a brighter place. You‚Äôve brought so much light and comfort into my life, and I hope you know how much you‚Äôre appreciated.

I‚Äôm so lucky to have met you. Thank you for being exactly who you are. My sweet boy, i love you forever and always

Today I paid for my flight, airbnb, and of course ticket to the convention! I already messaged my cousin telling him I will be in town that weekend and he plans to meet me and most likely attend the convention as well!

I am just excited because this will be my first ever SOLO trip! Back in 2020 I had a trip to LA planned for a concert BUT it got cancelled just like the rest of the world did. So this time I am gonna make it right!

Man I cant wait for my change of scenery and to be at that convention full of geeks like me!"

"First time I write down the words ""I'm happy"" Started to write down my thoughts in 2018. Was depressed very often, had some suicidal thoughts but rarely. Very pessimistic about life in general. 

Back then I wasn't happy but I was doing a lot of things. Started manual labor on a whim because I didn't find fullfilment in my studies. The job was hard, especially because I was not a manual persone at all. Boss was kindda nice outside of work but very demanding. I was depressed to go to work but still found good things here and there. Found out I was bisexual and on the aromantic spectrum wich both explained a lot of things from my past experiences. So life was hard, but it was changing.  So I started to put things on paper to sort them out.



Moved a lot, had a burnout in 2019 and a big alcool problem. Within the 3 last years I lost contact with almost all of my friends. Loneliness, alcool and burnout left me completely emptied. Had 1 complete month with the desire to end my life every fucking morning. Still wanted to end it all during the rest of the year but at least it wasn't every morning.



Came back in my home country right before COVID crisis. Worked 3 months, no right to any subsiddies or money during the crisis. Had to burn everything I had during the crisis to not go back to mom and dad. Good thing was that since everybody had times I took contact with my old friends and we played TTRPG online like in the good old days. Never lost contact with them since, turned out we're all somewhere on the LGBT spectrum one way or another. Loneliness was (mostly) gone, money was (completely) gone.

Started making money again, nothing special for 5 years. Don't like the work but you gotta do what you gotta do. Got better, started taking care of what I eat and worked out a bit. No sexual life at all, no social life except online with my old friends. After these very boring but also appeased years, I realize I prefer my friends over my family. I decide to go to a town where all my friends are.



It's been a year now, my old friends are by far my closest relationships I ever had. Joined LGBT and BDSM groups, I met new people and made some good acquaintances. Social life is better it ever was.  
  
I'm now at peace with my sexuality and the fact I am aromantic. I live alone but I have a very good sexlife. Hated hugs because I felt I had to do them when I was in relationships. Now I love them because it's just a mark of affection without romantic implication. Started seeing some of my close friends as sexfriends and it's going very well without any ambiguity. I do kinky things, vanilla things, I just take in the affection and the skinship after more than half a decade with almost none of it.

This morning I wrote down a bit on my journal I started in 2018. I don't write very often, depends on the timeframe but I took a look on the different entries. It's the first time ever I wrote that I am happy and that I feel good. I feel like, I just manage to turn a significant page of my life. "

"After a bad relapse I finally have crossed a month.  I suffer through several mental health issues and fell into substance abuse. 

I was clean for two years from April 2022 to April 2024. It was bad for these 6 months. I was completely lost and going through a real dark period. I had given up on me.

Finally what I was waiting for came along. That one moment of grace. I stood up and am trying to get my life back to track. It's not large numbers but I'm proud of myself. This is me trying. "
It‚Äôs not just that I‚Äôm happy‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs that I‚Äôm fully alive. This is 5yrs of transitioning into the person I was meant to be. (I‚Äôm open to answering questions!) 
"A girl (23) in my friend group admitted that she has a crush on me (25M)! And for years, I kinda sensed that she had some interest towards me given how she acted around me. But I didn't think she was full-blown crushing on me.

Last night, I, my twin brother, my ex-girlfriend, her brother, and the girl were smoking weed on the couch watching YouTube videos. She was sitting on my left, and as I was feeling so cozy, we started snuggling up, just resting our heads together at first. Then I started resting my head on her shoulder. After some time, I put my left arm fully around her while my right hand was placed on her right shoulder. As more time went on, I had my arms around her as if I was hugging her. I could feel her moving her arm to touch mine in an affectionate manner. Before you know it, we're now holding hands! Later on, I was massaging her hair, which she enjoyed. Towards the end, we were full-on cuddling together. Neither one of us wanted to let go.

The very next day, she texted me directly about how we held hands and cuddled. She said she was sad that it ended. I told her I enjoyed it, too. She then confessed that she had a crush on me for years and would have asked me to be her prom date had it not been canceled due to COVID.

I told her that I like her, too. And now we're going on a date next week!

tl;dr: I cuddled up with a girl in my friend group and later held hands with her. The very next day, she confessed that she had a crush on me, and we're going on a date next week!"
"(M30) Actually felt like I made my mom proud for the first time During Christmas I was visiting family for a few days. I was there with quite a few people including my mom, two older sisters, etc. I was having some conversation with one of my sisters about how my current job is really good and I'm finally in a good place. I'm in the best position I've ever been in; financially, mentally, physically. I never imagined I'd find something that could do this for me. During the conversation I hinted at how much I earned for the year and my sister seemed really surprised and happy for me. I could tell from her reaction she didn't expect me to be making as much as I did. She commented on how she didn't make that much until much further in her career. My mom overheard us talking and gave about the same reaction as my sister. 

Fast forward to the day I'm leaving to go back home and my mom told me she was proud of me. She was trying not to cry while telling me a few more times. It really hit me because I could tell how serious she was. I've never in my life felt like I could say I've ever made my mom proud until this moment. I've dealt with depression for the majority of my life and never imagined I'd live this long or even contemplate the possibility of retirement one day. I made it one day at a time practically my whole life and it was miserable. I'm so fortunate to finally have stability and I hope that I can continue to make my family proud."

"My grandkitty and I had a grand adventure! (OC) My grandkitty came to visit with my grown son and his SO while they‚Äôre home from Mississippi for the holidays. I finally got to meet her!

I‚Äôm highly allergic to cats, so I created a cozy outdoor space (I‚Äôm in Oklahoma) so we could spend some time together without her getting to chilly. I took antihistamines and wore a mask so we could cuddle and play. So worth it!

This was Juno‚Äôs first grand outdoor adventure on leash, and she had so much fun climbing a mega cat tree and exploring the backyard! "

"moved out for the 1st time. decorated my bedroom for the 1st time. when i lived with parents i was never allowed to have anything on my bedroom wall, no posters, no drawing, no photos. must keep empty. they were extremely controlling and abusive in many ways. one of the most insidious was financially abusing me. made me pay 60-80% of my salary as ‚Äúfood and board‚Äù. i scarped by for years to save enough to move out. i‚Äôm slowly learning i can decorate my apartment. i can choose my own bedsheets. i can hang a cool carpet of a bear playing guitar if i wanted to. wow. for reference i rented a 2 bedroom in a okey part of town with only 40% of my salary. it‚Äôs why i was ‚Äúmooching‚Äù off my parents.

He told me he loved me last night, and I felt every word he said and his look gave it all away. I‚Äôve never met someone who is willing to be vulnerable, and who has never understood me like he has. We constantly have deep conversations that last for hours and we‚Äôve moved slow in the right ways and fast in the right ways. I think I‚Äôm going to marry this man one day. I want to be with him until the day I die. So many weird things keep happening that don‚Äôt seem like coincidence. Everything feels right, and like it‚Äôs meant to be. I believe after all the years of torment in my life, I have finally found my home and my true happiness. I just wanted to share that I‚Äôm the happiest I‚Äôve been in a long long time.

"New relationship but I've not been this happy in nearly 10 years I have had some really bad luck with partners over the last 10 years or so. Along with long term health issues that past relationships didnt really support me with. My ex-wife and I divorced after she cheated on me. I had a couple of dating relationships since then but nothing has made me as happy as the girl I've been seeing for the last 2 months. 

She's only 2 years younger than me so we both have similar interests in our childhood (watched the same shows growing up in the 90s for example). 
We have the same political views and opinions.
We both don't want children.
She is very focused on her work, so she hasn't dated in a long time. She loves her job and it seems quite rewarding for her despite how difficult it is. She's extremely intelligent. I could sit and listen to her talk about anything at all.
She takes care of herself, both physically and mentally. She keeps herself fit at the gym but also makes sure she takes a Friday evening to relax in her bath and de-stress.
She speaks her mind about what she likes and dislikes, it's very refreshing after my past relationships. We can be very open with each other. 
Not to mention she's incredibly pretty. Gorgeous grey/blue eyes and brown/blonde hair shes growing out. I can lose myself looking at her like some kind of teenager on a first date. Insane body from her gym work too. Stong legs and arms, amazing ass, super smooth skin. I am way out of my league. 
I love just cuddling with her and listening to her get passionate about films and actors as we are watching TV. Just being near her and next to her makes my heart pound. She got into my car the other day with a comfy jumper and hair in a messy ponytail and she looked so perfect I couldn't process it and I felt my chest tighten with some sort of anxiety/happiness. 

I know it sounds stupid and lovey dovey. But I've not been this happy with someone. I think maybe ever. I can't even remember feeling like this when I met my ex wife. 
I love her. I haven't said it to her because I know it's too soon but I know I do. I think I knew it on our second date, and every day/evening/date we spend together, I know it more and more. I have to keep it under wraps a little as I don't want to scare her by being too crazy. But sometime soon it's just going to get blurted out without me thinking. "

"After five months of being up in the air about having a place to live as of NYE I've been in my room, MY room! Great start to the year."
"i love every good and bad experience i‚Äôve ever had. my life has not been the best, but it also hasn‚Äôt been the worse! i love that every day i can experience things that make my day good, and then bad, and then good again. even when my days end up awful.

this also goes for memories as well. i prefer to think about the good memories, of course, but thinking about the bad is important too. i‚Äôm grateful that i get to experience things and be a human being.

i find myself struggle to be positive or grateful of my life, but sometimes, like right now, i feel grateful for all of it."
"I broke out of my social comfort zone on NYE  I know this isn‚Äôt a major thing compared to some of the other posts in this sub, but Anxiety is one hell of a confidence reducer. before even heading to the party I was a mess of nerves but the second I headed in with my girlfriend I felt it leave me immediately. I talked to so many cool and friendly people and when I left the party I felt like I had crossed a crazy mental barrier, I couldn‚Äôt stop smiling. "
"my parents are dancing in the basement together for NYE date night i (23F) can hear my parents (56&53) swing dancing in thebasement together for new year's eve. my mom loves to dance, and my dad hates it/is embarrassed by his dancing but he loves my mom. i can hear my mom giggling and my dad trying his best to do a good job with her. they are very in love, always have been, and it makes me very happy. while things aren't perfect and they never will be, i am truly so lucky to have been raised by such loving people. "
"Went to a bar on New Year's Eve with my parents and made friends I've spent past New Year's Eves feeling lonely. This year, I decided to try something different and go to a bar in a nearby city. They had a breakfast bar out for people at midnight, but until then I just had three Pepsis and fries. I was beginning to feel tired, but I knew that I had to keep pushing through. Overall, the experience was nice, I met some nice people, and had a really good time. I learned that taking a chance and trying something new can be a good thing. I hope this encourages others to do the same ‚Äì you might be surprised at how much fun you have."
"Just Realized that Life is Never that Bad; I Can Burp Whenever I want Kind of sounds like a joke, but I'm serious. Burping is so funny to me, so the fact that I can on-command burp whenever I want really brightens my day, not too sure why!"

"I disabled instagram notifications. I‚Äôm so much happier now. For some context I got addicted to instagram like 3 months ago and I‚Äôve been on a mental downward spiral eversince. 

I loved this girl that I knew irl. We chatted on instagram after she moved away to boardingschool. It was very good at first but then the delay in texting back on her end just got longer and longer. It hurt me so much that I cried almost every night. I would keep on waiting for a notification and hope that she responded to me or texted me. Each time I got a notification I would get so excited only for it to not be her responding and that made me cry even more. 

It took me 3 months to realise that I needed to do something about my mental health. So one day I decided that enough is enough and I completely disabled every notifications for instagram and started focusing on myself and my image. 

Its been amazing so far. Ive improved so much compared to 3 moths ago in so many diffrent aspects of my life. (I still do cry about her because she has an amazing personality and a brilliant mind but its more like once every 7-9 days). 

I just wanted to share my story here. Hope you can relate to it in some way or another! "

üéâNEW YEAR GUYS!üéâ"
" I Realized I Only Get Excited About Things, Not Truly Happy A few days ago, I had a big realization. I noticed that I only get *excited* about certain things‚Äîlike a new project, a quick freelance gig, or something I‚Äôve been waiting for‚Äîbut deep down, I‚Äôm not really *happy*. It‚Äôs like my life is running on moments of adrenaline, but the overall vibe is... dull.

For the past two years, I‚Äôve been working from home almost exclusively, doing some freelancing on the side. That means I spend most of my days indoors and most of my nights awake. Seeing the outside world has become rare, and the routine is starting to suffocate me.

So, I‚Äôve decided to make some big changes:

1. **I‚Äôm buying a bike** to go on tours and explore. I miss the feeling of fresh air, open roads, and just being *out there*.
2. I‚Äôm switching to a **hybrid work setup**, where I‚Äôll spend some days working from an office. I think being around people and breaking the monotony of home life will help.

I‚Äôm sharing this because I feel like a lot of us have been stuck in similar cycles since the pandemic and remote work became the norm. If you‚Äôve been through something like this, how did you break out of it?"

"After 10 years, got closure and a good friend back It feels so good to have that weight lifted. I had a best friend, and as it goes sometimes, we thought it would be a good idea to be more than friends. It was an exciting whirlwind after high school that ended abruptly one day...I was confused and hurt. We haven't really talked in 10 years or so. 10 years later, we both have families, and my wife and her are great friends, I'm friends with her husband, and we've been hanging out, though her and I just kind of mutually exist without really talking very much. 

Anyway, the other night we had a really great conversation, talked over things for the first time in 10 years, and it felt like a weight lifted. Simply put: we were always just better friends than anything else. It feels like the old, pre-craziness times again, and I couldn't be happier to have gained a friend back that I really missed. If it makes sense, I really didn't miss the relationship, I missed the friendship without the complications. Now that's back and I'm ecstatic."
"I GOT STRAIGHT As THIS SEMESTER FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER!!! So, I‚Äôm someone who has always done fairly well academically. In high school, I maintained a B+/A- average with a ton of AP and honors classes. However, what prevented me from achieving higher grades (that I knew I could achieve) was not having the proper accommodations I needed until my senior year of high school and college subsequently. 

The closest I had gotten to having straight As (before this semester) was my first semester of senior year of high school. I got 3 -As, 1 B+, and the rest of the grades were As. While this is really good, one of my goals for college was to have at least one semester where I had straight As (no -As, just As).

After a lot of work, having the proper accommodations I need, and dealing with a lot personally this semester, I opened my unofficial transcript this evening. Not only did I get straight As, but my GPA went up to a 3.85! 

I‚Äôm so freaking happy and proud of myself. I hope next semester‚Äôs grades are good like this!!!!

I gave up throwing pots for many years because of painful systemic arthritis. This year I learned that I can still make SMALL beautiful things that make me super happy. 
"Reflecting on a Transformative Year: Teaching, Personal Growth and Finding Myself  I‚Äôve written a reflective post of my year that I was going to post but I don‚Äôt know how well it will go with people I know, so instead I‚Äôd like to share it here‚Ä¶ 

This year has been nothing short of transformative. After years of hard work, late nights, and moments of doubt, I finally completed my degree in teaching‚Äîa goal that once felt so far out of reach. For a long time, it was a dream others doubted I could achieve, but here I am, standing on the other side of that accomplishment with pride and gratitude.

Finishing my degree wasn‚Äôt just about earning a qualification‚Äîit was about proving to myself that perseverance and dedication can turn even the most daunting goals into reality.

But the journey didn‚Äôt stop there. This year also marked the start of my career as a teacher. My first year in the classroom has been full of ups and downs, surprises, and so much growth. Teaching has challenged me in ways I never imagined but has also been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. Helping young minds grow, seeing their lightbulb moments, and navigating the complexities of this role has reinforced why I chose this path.

On top of that, I took a leap of faith and moved far away to live in a remote area. My earlier experiences taught me the grounding and healing power of new environments, and I knew this move was exactly what I needed.

Living here has been a roller coaster of a time‚Äîeye-opening, challenging, and deeply rewarding. To experience the serenity and vastness of the landscape daily has been exactly what my heart and mind needed to reset and recharge. The quiet moments and connection to nature have reminded me what it means to truly live. It‚Äôs a slower, more intentional way of being, and it has given me a clarity I didn‚Äôt know I was missing.

Becoming My True Self
This year has also deepened my journey of becoming my most authentic self. Transitioning has been a process of discovering, embracing, and becoming the person I‚Äôve always known myself to be. With each passing year, the changes I‚Äôve experienced‚Äîphysically, emotionally, and mentally‚Äîhave brought me closer to alignment with my true self.

It hasn‚Äôt always been an easy journey, but the rewards have been transformative. I‚Äôve grown in confidence, self-acceptance, and pride in who I am. Living authentically is not just about external changes; it‚Äôs about stepping into life as the person I‚Äôve always been, and I can honestly say I‚Äôve never felt more at home in myself.

The Power of Connection
One of the most meaningful parts of this year has been the connections I‚Äôve built with the people around me. Working alongside others, learning from diverse perspectives, and immersing myself in a rich culture of understanding have strengthened me in ways I didn‚Äôt expect. These experiences have helped me develop a deeper sense of belonging and purpose in my work and personal life.

Finding common ground with others, sharing knowledge, and collaborating on meaningful goals have reminded me of the power of community, even in the most unfamiliar places. These relationships have been a source of inspiration and growth, showing me that connection is at the heart of resilience and fulfillment.

This year wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without the incredible people in my life. To everyone who has supported me, encouraged me, and believed in me‚Äîthank you. Your kindness and words of affirmation have kept me going when things felt overwhelming.

A special acknowledgment goes to someone very dear to me who is no longer here. Their unwavering belief in me and their endless support are the reasons I‚Äôve been able to accomplish all of this. I know their spirit has been with me every step of the way, and I truly wouldn‚Äôt be where I am without the love and encouragement they gave me.

And, as if this year wasn‚Äôt full enough, I also added a new dog to my little fur family. Their companionship has been a constant source of joy, humor, and love, making my days brighter and my life richer.

Looking back, this year has been about embracing change, leaning into challenges, and celebrating milestones that once felt impossible. Completing my degree, starting my teaching career, and building a life that feels authentically mine are things I‚Äôm immensely proud of.

As I welcome the new year, I carry with me the lessons of resilience, self-trust, and gratitude for how far I‚Äôve come. Here‚Äôs to another year of growth, connection, and new adventures.

Happy New Year, everyone‚Äîmay it be kind, bold, and full of possibility.

"I finally managed to read more than one free-reading book this year, in more than fifteen years! I‚Äôve actively avoided free reading for fifteen years. I don‚Äôt know why, but between college and all the stress in my life, I fell out of love with reading. This year, however, not only have I managed to read one book, but four! I‚Äôve totaled over a thousand pages this year, guys! It feels so good to sit back down and read, and while I‚Äôm still struggling to do so with frequency, I‚Äôve finally gotten back into reading!"

"2024 was the absolute best year of my life (so far) At 00:01 on the first of January a friend said: let this year be free of suffering.

[26F]
It's the year I was more happy than unhappy and the ratio is around 75% to 25%.

A general feeling of love and being loved, of being healthy and young. 

Wrote, illustrated and published a little fictional book based on 3 years of schizophrenia. I am now mostly healed and in a calm and enjoyable state of maybe still a bit between realities but am not afraid of it. Packed the book with paradoxes and hopefully transmitted a feeling of a mind a bit too open. 

Worked in different fields: as a 3D artist & as a journalist in my third! language only to realize I reaaaally don't like a 9-5 as it eats all the good time out of life. 

Having been to 3 crazy parties of the same kind, making each time new friends and dressing up in aetheric outfits.

Last month laid first steps to something very life-changing, very excited to see where it goes:

Heard this phrase of ""you can choose your thoughts yourself, instead of them flying into your head"". Have also discovered a very interesting state of mind, rooted in playfulness towards life and somewhat flirtiness? So funny:)

Very excited for 2025. Have big plans:)

Wishing you a lovely New Year and please journal on the change of years. It's a magical time! If you don't know what questions to ask yourself, Google or ask chatGPT. Maybe write a letter to yourself 365 days into the future:)"

"I felt overwhelming joy for the first time in years today  For background I‚Äôve been suffering from a pretty deep depression for the past 6 years or so. And for the past couple days I‚Äôve been at home sick with the flu. So I‚Äôve been forced to take a break. And today I decided to listen to some scores from the Star Wars film soundtracks because I saw a guy talking about it online. I decided to put on Across the stars, and it made me so happy. So happy I started to bawl my eyes out. When I was a kid Star Wars was my favorite thing in the whole wide world, it was the thing that me and my best friend bonded over. I would listen to Star Wars film scores as a kid to fall asleep. It just brought back so many emotions. I feel so overwhelmed with joy and it‚Äôs so cathartic. And so unexpected. I hadn‚Äôt watched or engaged in star wars content in 6 years during my depression. It‚Äôs like seeing an old friend. "

"new resident (both in the medical sense and living sense) to Colorado, have seen our neighborhood bald eagle 3(-5?) times now ü•π all spotted while driving around (within a 10-15 mile radius) from our apartment! And now that I‚Äôve seen them twice, my partner once, I am pretty sure I‚Äôve seen him 2 other times in retrospect! 
I‚Äôm an internal medicine resident, and I worked on Thanksgiving and Christmas this year. It‚Äôs been a rewarding but also extremely challenging first 6 months as a doctor. So many cultures view eagles as a spiritual sign, and to have one visit me/us so many times has felt like a kind of spiritual encouragement. 
And to all who also worked this year during the holidays - serving food, keeping important places like hospitals clean, and those unpaid labors of cooking, cleaning,  jobs of parents, caretakers, etc. , sending love and thanks, hoping for more peace and joy in the new year "
"I‚Äôve had the best Christmas despite not having anything on the table. I get 2 spend it with the 2 love of my life. 

I was so close to giving up my 2 dogs for adoption. Things this year has been nothing but rough and I dreaded for Christmas to come since I feel like there is nothing to celebrate. I was so scared for the past couple of weeks that I‚Äôve failed my dogs, run out of insulin for my diabetic dog so I had to consider adoption but Christmas do really come with miracles since some unexpected money came and I was able to get my dog some insulin for the next 2 weeks which would buy me time to figure things out.

Im just genuinely happy that I still get to be with my dog. I probably wont be able to afford to celebrate new year but who cares as long as my dogs are with me ill be the happiest girl there is. 

Any advice on where I can get dog food as well? Im running out and the shelter where I get it has been closed during the holiday seasons which doesnt make sense. Anything as well to make rice taste a lot better?

Finally bought my class for motorcycle classes I have been wanting to do this for years and now I finally bought the classes to get my license. Already have my eyes on the Kawasaki Eliminator as my first bike. Just so excited to get started on the riding journey! 
"My wife payed me a nice compliment today.  Today my wife sincerely told me that I seem like I'm always happy. I've worked on myself and my life (It's a work that's always in progress) for several years now with such things as theorapy, spirtual practices and meditation. What she told me is what I've been trying to achieve- possibly all my life! I'm extremely happy now and I had a nice, peaceful Chrismas with family yesterday so things are good! I just thought I'd share this with you all!"
"Fitness milestone for me, I‚Äôm about 160 lbs ( Bench is 230 lbs, idk what happened to the text"
"First time having a lengthy conversation with my mum.  I'm 26(M) and this is the first time I'm spending Christmas alone. (I was staying with my parents after university up until March this year when my parent's business crumbled and they had to sell the house we were leaving in to pay back a bank loan and they moved back to the village and I ended up renting in the city alone)

I didn't do much for Christmas of course but I treated myself to some nice lunch at a nearby restaurant.

I spent the better part of the day just doom-scrolling in bed till my mum called late in the evening.

I'm African and the relationship with my parents is bitter-sweet and we don't have a strong emotional bond like it's sold in most western movies let alone anything to discuss. It's basically the traditional African-esque relationship where the family is like the army where there's mutual respect but zero emotions at all.

So for a long time, conversations with both my parents on the phone have never lasted more than a minute, it's always straight to the point interrogation-like conversations.

Today however was so different, my mum initially called looking for help about some settings on her phone. after taking her through it and having having her issue resolved, she went on to ask me how I was doing and how I was spending christmas. and of course we went through our usual question-answer ""interrogation"".

I don't know whether it was something in the air or it actually was the ""Christmas spirit"", but we continued talking for a little while longer than we usually do. It felt awkward at first but we just kept on going.

It was so different this time round I even thought for a second that I was talking to someone else. She talked with this calmess and tranquility and soon we were just chatting away, I don't even remember half of the conversation we had.

There's that African fear/respect we were taught to have for parents growing up and so having a candid conversation with a parent is something I never quite thought was possible. And the fact that she was just so jolly and laughing out loud without any ""mask"" during the conversation kinda melted my heart.

There's that judgemental, assertive and authoritative tone most african parents always used when we were kids that kinda of acts as a catalyst in us building these emotional walls most of us have around our parents and sort of makes up keep our parents at arms distance. But this time when were talking, I could sense that it wasn't there. It was just her

What I thought was going to be a 2 minute conversation ended up being a 2 hour emotional roller-coaster and it could have been longer had her battery not died out.

When she hung up, I couldn't believe what had just happened and found myself so emotional and was crying(something I hadn't done since my days in high school). I was so happy and in that moment, I felt so full of life.

If anything, this has got to be the experience of my year and for it to happen on Christmas felt like the perfect gift for me.

Even now I still can't believe it happened and just find myself smiling everytime I remember it and it's the best feeling in the world man."
Just got my account back after thinking it was gone for months! :D
"I'm about to look how I've wanted since I became trans. And I'm excited  I have this show called NightNGale, and in said show, I have a self insert. When I first made him before I transitioned, I made him with one goal in mind. To be like him. 

About a year later, I finally have all the stuff TO be able to look like him and finally be comfortable with myself a lot more without binding my chest. (I will later) I have so much to customize myself so i can look like him. 

I'm happy. I'll show the outfit soon once I get everythung!! "
My partner made me my favorite asparagus recipe as a Christmas gift. It‚Äôs the best thing I‚Äôve ever ate! I can particularly taste the lemon juice and love she put into it :)
My beloved and I cooked our first Christmas dinner together. Happy Christmas everyone. I hope you can share moments with the ones you love in this day.
"First Christmas alone- went volunteering and had a lot of fun :) Things w my family aren‚Äôt great this year and I‚Äôm single, so my first Xmas being alone ahaha, but i signed up to volunteer at an event for the homeless this morning and it was so much fun! I met a lot of nice people and i was a bit nervous about being alone there but i met a guy who was also there on his own and we talked for most of the whole time and he was really nice and friendly. The event was passing out food, clothes, supplies. Was worried about being alone this xmas but I‚Äôm actually happy right now :)"

"My birds have been so brave recently, and began trusting me more! We've had budgies (Angel and Charlie) for 3-4 years. Today I was putting a new toy in for them for Christmas(I'm putting another one in later and then gonna change their food), and they were so brave. They used to be terrified at any change, and while they're still scared, they were way calmer! I'm so proud of them, and happy that they're trusting me and the rest of my family more! I love them so much, they truly make my day ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è They're singing is beautiful. I love them.

Merry Christmas!"
It‚Äôs been a brutal year w my health. Thank you to a sub that helped me through some pretty dark days. A bunch of internet strangers came to the rescue. I‚Äôm grateful ‚ù§Ô∏è 
"I had an incredible year and I‚Äôm excited for the next!!! At the beginning of the year, I wrote down some resolutions and posted them on Reddit(got into some argument with a mod and lost that account but wtv). They included firstly to graduate, go vegan, and better my French. I not only graduated with good grades from my toxic uni and healed my broken mental state, but also got to work at my dream organisation. I'm not vegan yet but I've greatly reduced my animal products consumption and I'm volunteering in the animal welfare space. My French isn't perfect but half my social media is French memes and TikTok's so I'm forcing myself to at least passively practice. I also made new friends and strengthened old friendships which was HUGE for an introvert like me looking for people to do cool stuff with. 

Next year I'm starting a new position at work better than what im currently in, im working on projects that excite me in the things I'm volunteering for, and a guy who's kinda cute asked me on a date, so maybe that will lead somewhere idk. Im just so happy!!!

There have been lows too, really terrible, soul crushing lows. But I'm glad I am in a new chapter, have renewed confidence and am actually really beginning to feel like an adult. It took me a long time to get this peace and I could just cry from joy.

My only hope is that next year will be even better <3"
"Happy with life, received cutest christmas gifts I have full face grin since morning! Growing up - never received Christmas gifts (christmas is not celebrated in my culture) whereas my husband's side of the family always exchanged Christmas gifts.
Since last year, my husband started Christmas gift for me (i keep stocking out in the night) and today morning i woke up with tons of chocolates and cutest PJ set (my first PJ's as a gift) Im just soooo happy!!! Grateful for my husband too, he is cutest and always puts in soooo much effort ‚ô•Ô∏è just wanted
to share!"
Wishing you all a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! 
I baked some apple pies to gift to friends for Christmas. 
"Ik its not a crazy physique, but considering I have pectus excavatum, Im happy.  "
"all this food donated to me by the local church in the spirit of Christmas much more extensive than previous years, they even added refrigerated items and 3 chunks of fancy mystery cheese"
Was told my credit score went up. So happy I was able to make this happen.  
"So happy because of my new roommate/landlord!  He saved me and has blessed me with a hot tub! eeeep mukyu.  i am so happy at the moment ‚ú®  so basically like, i had an extremely bad year at college üò≠ and i got put on academic probation (yea yea i know there will people calling me out, go ahead u nerdsss ü§ì) and during this break, i had to move back with my bad family which forced me to sleep in the living room with 20 cats üêà and would go out there while i slept and make enough noise to wake the dead...ON PURPOSE.. üò´üò´üò´ plus my family is a pain to live with since they dont have jobs nor the ability to manage money, so they constantly hound me for money but i dont give them any cause they will just spend it on pop, weed, and fast food.

seeing no other options, i decided to look into finding my own place with my savings.  today i found a really nice and CHEAP listing for a room for rent near me that was legit 350 a month.  i gasped, danced, shook with excitement, curled my toes, and jumped up in down... what a deal! ü§ùüíº‚úÖ plus it says that's all i need to pay, no bills or anything.

i called the guy who made the ad, and he told me i could move in whenever i wanted, and he told me a bunch of things about him, the house, and the other roommates that indicate ""wow he's so chill"".  my favorite things about him is he says he has a hot tub üõÅüßñ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è i can use whenever (you are true sigma and the coolest if you have one), that him and all the other roommates are ex military or current militaryü™ñ (very disciplined and i imagine easy to live with compared to my family) and that he will even pick me up and help me move my things tomorrow with his car, because i dont have a car or license (will fix that soon, vroom vroom initial d ‚õê)

the cherry on top of the cake?  the one thing that told me ""wow this guy is human""? he tells me that since it's so close to 2025, if i moved in tomorrow, i could just write my rent check on jan 1st and live there for free until then.  ""to see if you like it"" is what he said.

he was able to pick me up today for a tour, and OMG.  the house is perfect!  big and the other roommate i met was so nice!  my room was so big and my bed so bouncy and big (judge me idc i like jumping on beds) rn i am fantasizing about relaxing in that hot tub christmas eveüéÑtomorrow, drinking ramune from walmart and playing with my rubber duck toy.  i hope i can have my laptop close and reply to newer comments on this post, all in the nice warm water.  then i want to fall asleep in my big bed safe n' warm.  life is going to get very good come tomorrow, when i will move.  i will get a job (easy in my town, lots of stuff) and study coding hard and fix the college issue when im not working.  luckily, if all this stuff trying to fix my life gets too much, i will have a hot tub to retreat to."
"I get to spend the night with my mom for the first time in 10 years!

"I had a really awesome day with my brother! I have a brother who's 14 (nearly 15) years younger than me. My relationship with my family has never been good, and my family in general is all fractured and very broken. Growing up I was concerned for my brother and the way he was being raised, he was spoilt and had incredibly soft parenting, so I took the role of the grumpy one who gave him hard rules and boundaries, but I did it because I cared greatly for him. One of my biggest fears was my my brother realising I'm gay and not liking me any more, it's been ages since I felt fear around my sexuality, yet this terrified me. Like I said, my family situation is messy, but I really want a happy relationship with him

A few times my brother's came over to my place, and we'll scream and cry with laughter, we're both gamers, so we just play games together and have so much fun! I think he likes that I've never gone easy on him, I always make him work for a victory and don't like to treat him like a child. And, yeah, I know he knows I'm gay now, but it's never been an issue, that means so much to me

Today however we went and saw Sonic 3 in the cinema, just the two of us, and it made my soul happy getting to just watch a film with him, laugh together, then talk about it with each other. I have memory issues, so for an early Christmas present and to tie the memory to something physical, I got us both these Sonic popcorn buckets, he seemed super happy about it and really grateful! He's 14 now, so he's maturing and changing, I mentioned one of my favourite jokes in the movie and asked if he understood it, and he said with a really confused face ""What? The scene where the woman hands them two crossbows and one's a lot smaller than the o-"" then he started half smiling and half laughing as he went ""Aaaahhh"" and just seeing him work that out, it keeps making me laugh! :')

I was always so scared he'd hate me, I was strict, I said no a lot, I could be mean. But no one else would be that person, he needed it so I knew I had to be. So the fact he still likes to spend these moments with me, he text me the other day to show me he started playing Kingdom Hearts 3 again. Life really hasn't been great in general, but knowing my brother likes me and wants to share moments like this with me, it means more to me than I can put into words. It's really made me truly happy getting to spend a part of my day with him, and he mentioned he'd love to watch Jurassic Park in 4D with me in the future if it comes back! It makes me so happy, I really am grateful for this relationship"

"My boyfriend‚Äôs love languages perfectly line up with mine My boyfriend‚Äôs love languages are gift giving and physical contact. 

I for one in my one past relationship always was the gift giver but it turns out thats actually what I wanted to receive FROM a partner. 
It‚Äôs more so for me the actual act of: I have been thinking of you and I know you well enough to know what you like, and I went out of my way and spent time looking for this thing. 

I find it really sweet and anyway my boyfriend got me an advent calendar after asking me out because Ive never had one before (and my last many Christmases have been traumatic.) Along with that he got the exact teddy I have been wanting. He is such a sweetie pie.

I was a teacher for several years and it sucked the life out of me. I changed professions and I literally changed my appearance (10 months apart). 
"I'm crying out of joy for a first time in my life... I don't know where to start. I'm 26yo male that changed his own life in 6 months - I was fat, I was in a relationship for 4 years I knew that was leading nowhere, I was too in my comfort zone (introverted as fuck) and I don't know what else ...

  
Half a year back I started to be really dissapointed about my shape so I started walking 10K steps every day and started counting calories to be in a deficit. After 6 months I lost 25kg which made me look really different (obviously).

In past 4 years I was really closed up, didn't engage in any type of new friendships, no social activities etc

After 4 years of my a wee bit toxic relationship that I knew was leading nowhere, because she way too often reminded me about she didn't want any kids or marry me and some other things. I finally found that bit of ""courage"" and broke up with her in November.  4 years is a really long time and I was really afraid that I would feel so damn lonely especially at this time of year and in a flat where it is just me and my dog - GUESS WHAT! I feel no such thing as sad or lonely, only ""negative"" thing is that I didn't do that earlier but I'm not going to take that feeling any further - why?

What is happening now or since those 6 months?

* Became more ""stress free""
* Lost weight (still have to get rid of loose skin but fuck it, I will be able to do that!)
* Noticed that a really cute girl was smiling at me so I made my move and brought her out on a 2nd date (I blow up the 1st one but this time I was doing good and it felt more natural) that she is the first person ever to tell me I'm looking handsome and that she loves my eyes. We are able to just talk for literally hours and never get rid of topics.  At work I'm going by her and we stare at each other with a smile.
*  I was (for the first time) on a company Christmas party where I got drunk, danced after random girl came to me and dragged me to a dance floor and I loved every minute of it (until the morning hangover hit me).
* Got really close to a few of my workmates and realized how such a great people they are and how they supported me before/after break up and how they motivated me to be better in my personal life.
* I bought new clothes I'm finally comfortable in.
* All of sudden I realized that young girls (19-25yo) are either giving me ""the look"" or started OUT OF NOWHERE talking to me. I'm still not used to this, but damn it feels good. And I hope I'm not dreaming or imagining things since they smile at me and asking me random stuff that are not related to our/mine job.

I don't know what else to say ... I woke up at night and started thiking about that all and ended up crying out of joy. I just have the feeling that I'm finally myself. That I'm thankful for those coworkers and new friends around me. That I was able to say to myself ""do this, do that - it is neccessary"" and really took those steps to be better, to be what I'm now. It took time, some things wasn't that pleasant, but in the end it has to be done. My workmates (the are all females) told my that I'm a man any girl would want: I know my priorities, I'm not stupid, I can handle stuff, I'm calm, I can take care of things and that I'm handsome (like what the hell is happening around me?)

I don't want to compare my troubles with someone else who might be in a worse position, because **comparison is a thief of joy** and I don't want to feel sorry for what I'm doing. I'm writing all this because I'm happy and I want to pass the message that anyone can do anything.

I have some plans for myself, because I don't want to say ""okay, I achieved everything I wanted"". No. I want to feel that ""phase 1 ended, phase 2 started"" - I want to start jogging, hitting the gym, maybe try to start with box, but I should definitely take some dance classes to really overcome my fear of dance floor and be more relaxed. Maybe apply for army reserves ... so much ahead, but I love it."
"I‚Äôve sent email to myself during my teenagehood , it made me smile to receive it only now, and I wanted to share it because I don‚Äôt know I like the way it‚Äôs kinda cringe  Dear Future Me,

I don‚Äôt know about you, but here, I‚Äôm still a huge fan of comics, and Spider-Man is still the most inspiring character. Never stray from the right path: ‚ÄúWhen you can help someone, you have a moral obligation to do so.‚Äù

I trust you, future me. You‚Äôre (my age) now. You have responsibilities, duties‚Äîdon‚Äôt give up, I‚Äôm really counting on you.

Alright, I‚Äôll stop here. I‚Äôve got some ironing to do. Have a great day, and happy birthday, Raph (I just hope no one‚Äôs still calling you ‚ÄúLoulou‚Äù by now‚Äîit‚Äôs unbearable).

You‚Äôve come such a long way‚Ä¶

Okay, for real, I‚Äôll leave you alone now. But if you‚Äôre reading this with someone you love, hold onto her with everything you‚Äôve got. Love her endlessly. Don‚Äôt make the same mistakes I did. Don‚Äôt be stupid. Give me the chance to feel happy and fulfilled too.

Alright, I‚Äôm done for real this time. (I hope you‚Äôve stayed handsome.)"

"I am doing a perspective of my life and I am glad I overstepped the alcohol ‚Äúis cool‚Äù The first time I drank alcohol‚Äînot just sneaking a sip from my dad‚Äôs glass‚Äîwas when I was 18. Before that, I had always refused to drink because my parents had issues with alcohol at home, and I wanted nothing to do with it. When I finally did, it was during a party, and it went really well‚ÄîI had fun with my friends, no regrets.

For about a year after that, I started partying a lot and drinking pretty often. But now, honestly, I barely drink anymore. I‚Äôll have a drink during specific events, like parties, but when I do drink, I go all in‚Äînot just a little sip. That said, I only ever drink with my friends. I‚Äôve never drunk in front of my parents or my siblings, and with my girlfriend, it‚Äôs at most a glass on a terrace.

These days, I party much less because, well, adult life and less free time. Surprisingly, I don‚Äôt miss it at all‚ÄîI‚Äôm perfectly fine with it
I know that sounds stupid but I am in my 20s and I am surprised that some people sometimes judge me when I say I don‚Äôt want to go out drinking.

"I checked my emails this morning and saw that I finally graduated community college after transferring to a different school almost 2 years ago! It‚Äôs about damn time!

I went to my local community college starting in 2021, and after a lot of miscommunication, misunderstanding, and being screwed out of degree credits because of technicality and semantics,  I would have had to wait an entire year to take only 2 classes to get the degree I was in. I decided to miss out on getting my diploma and transfer out to a four year school to work on a degree thats related to what I was doing initially but more aligned with my goals for the future, BUT when I was setting up my transfer between schools, I met with my advisor and opted to back-transfer the credits I achieved at the new school.

Thankfully I did that because now I am finally receiving my associates! Time to conquer this bachelors!"

During covid - like many - I was depressed, alcoholic and in debt. I‚Äôm proud to say that I am in a better mental state, no longer an alcoholic and I turned my debt into savings. And I am in the process of opening my own business on top of losing ton of weight and getting in shape.I‚Äôve done a lot and I am proud of it.. Kind of.

I know that this is a feel happy subreddit, but I have a twist. I think that I have a severe case of imposter syndrome. I‚Äôm getting a lot of compliments and attention. People around me say that my transformation is inspiring them. But deep down, I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve it for some reason.

Like, I know I should be happy, and I am on some level. But it feels like it is one step removed. Like I am happy for someone else. I feel guilt, like nothing good should ever happen to me for some reason and I do not want to feel that way.

I want to be truly happy. I want to be proud of my accomplishment, cause I know that I‚Äôve earned it and I want to celebrate it.

Till that happens, I‚Äôm gonna fake it till I make it into happines and say fuck yeah I‚Äôm happy!!

"I just got my genetic testing back! My heart is not going to explode! My family has a genetic disease called Loeys-Dietz syndrome. It's also known as Familial Aortic Dissection Disorder. Basically, at any point in our life (but usually between the ages of 45-60), our aorta can basically decide to split and burst. According to my sister, it feels like if someone ripped apart your chest with their bare hands. 

While it is usually something that you worry about later in life, our family has historically been affected by it at a young age. My sister had her first dissection at 18. Her second on her 30th birthday. My other sister recently had her first dissection at 35. It is by luck that both of them survived it. It usually is a death sentence. It has killed quite a few family members, and there are several others who died of random ""cardiac issues"" before we had a diagnosis. 

With my sister getting it this last year, that met the threshold for the insurance company to cover the genetic testing. We had to have 5 family members experience a dissection *and* test positive for the gene. The chances of inheriting the gene are 50/50. You either have it or you don't. 

I just heard back! I don't have the gene. I've lived with this for 15 years! Getting regular echocardiograms, CT scans, etc. I always lived under the assumption that I had it and it would get me. But not anymore! "

"Enjoyed my favorite sandwich for lunch! Yum! Smoked salmon on toasted everything bagel and extra everything sprinkles.

"Super grateful to be here üôèüèºMoved to the US in 2020 with one suitcase, no family. No risk, no story.  Just found this subreddit today and felt like this would be a great place to share something happy. Moved to the US in 2020 all by myself with one suitcase, very little money and no family. I always knew as a kid I belonged here and would always dream of living in this country. Well, hard work and determination pays off. 

I had just graduated from college. I had been in the US multiple times before, so this was my final decision to move mid Covid as there was only one charter flight. 

In the past 4 years, I have learned how to thrive on my own, put one foot in front of the other and make my dreams come true. I am beyond thankful and grateful for all the blessings in my life, all the lessons and people I‚Äôve met here. It‚Äôs been a great journey. And I am thankful to be able to help my family as well. 

I hope that this post inspired someone out there. No matter the circumstances, you can do it. The Universe has your back! ü§çüôèüèº"
"Not much in my bank account, but I feel so fortunate "
"my fav artist recognised me (not very ""nsfw"" but yea) not much good happens in life to me but when it does, i make sure i'm extra thankful. "
My friends and me at our Secret Santa gift exchange party 
"Made dinner for my pregnant wife and daughter and they told me how much I mean to them.  

My pregnant wife and 9 year old daughter requested breakfast for dinner so I made a big batch of scrambled eggs with buttery toast and turkey bacon and proceeded to serve my girls their plates and hang out with them on the couch while Netflix played in the background, my daughter gave me a big hug and told me how good dinner was and thanked me for cooking for her and my wife told me how much she appreciated me as she finished her dinner and I played with her hair; with them both telling me how much they loved me and telling me that I take good care of them. I didn't come from the best family or have the happiest childhood and I like to think that I've broken the cycle with my own family. I feel like the richest man on the planet. Life is good and I didn't think I'd ever have half of what I have. I'm feeling blessed. Glad I stayed to see myself get this far. Life is beautiful. "
"Making the commute just a little bit better, one ticket at a time. On the Glasgow train lines there is a ticket lady, she's a great ticket lady. For babies and children she has a box of cut up ticket paper with handwritten tickets, She sat down and told me toddler that they are a VIP (very important passenger) and it's great they were making the journey today. This mama's day was made. I believe she carries dog treats for any canine passengers too."
"My sailor is graduating soon and I cannot be more proud. I am so proud of my family.

MY BOYFRIEND IS GRADUATING SOON! I AM SO PROUD OF HIM. He's been in the Navy for about 2 years and hes not really been enjoying it, but all the work he's been putting in is finally about to be rewarded. It's bittersweet because he will be moving after, but our daughter and I are going with him on vacation to spend time with his family over the holidays. I'm so happy and I'm so proud of him. Y'all he's worked so hard. I finally came here to post because I am just so proud of him and quite frankly my friends are sick of my boasting about it. He's so amazing. He's an amazing sailor, he's an amazing man, he's an amazing lover, and he's an amazing father. I love him so much. IM SO PROUD. wooop! WOOOP! I LOVE HIM! AHHHH!! IM SO HAPPY!"
"My youngest is growing a business helping kids with special needs.  In 2nd grade his teacher told us that he was a wise and kind old soul. She couldn't have been more right. He is so full of empathy and kindness. 

His social circle revolves around MMA training and the gym. He was recruited to be a trainer with nuerodivergiant (autistic) kids. He eventually went out on his own and this year he went from just himself to having 4 trainers and an admin. So happy and proud of him. 

Ms. Baker, I'm sorry how many hours he practices punching people in the face. üòÑ"
"Just submitted an assignment and it made me reflect on how good my life's been lately  Funnily enough I've been experiencing some mild depression. But even that feels chill because its December,  me and my flatmate aren't talking right now and it's assignment week so it all makes sense.

My assignment was really good. I had terrible tech problems uploading it but I felt minimum stress about it. 

I'm half way through my degree now. I love my job and once I qualify I'll be on good money. I'm finally debt free and managed to save 5k this year. My relationship with my family is healing. I finally found a physio who could help with my chronic pain. My dog is cute. My friends are great. I've finally learned to stand up for myself. My therapist thinks I don't need to keep going. 

I'm so proud of myself. I don't want to go on about it to people itl but I just needed to share"
"Every single prayer I have done since converting few months ago to Christianity has been answered in unexplainable ways. I just want to be happy and share my happiness. 

I pray daily, not to always just ask for stuff of if im needing help of course but to give thanks, so i am able to still know every single thing i have prayed about that WAS about a question, help with a situation, to know next steps on something, etc. 

I even let God know, that only if its in alignment with his will- that if i am meant to suffer through it- of course let me- but even then- sometimes same day, next day- never longer than a week, my answer is given real unexplainably to have been coincidence, my whole entire situations turned completly upside down to good WITH extra good in turn, thoughts i struggle with replaced. 

  
I know in the christian religion it was said that he answers all prayers, even thuogh we dont notice or its suffering instead to receive the inheritance later- but to imagine this type of love that god has for us and that i would ever actually experience it- i would have never thought possible in all my life. 

  
i just wanted to share my happiness is finding love. fixing my wrongs. being a better person. and changing my life with accountability, and in ways that are not human hands.

"My mother (mid 40s) is finally trying to understand me as a person (17 ftm) instead of trying to shape me into the person she wants me to be. This is a happy rant because I just want to get this out. My mother is finally starting to understand me as a person. She's starting to understand my interests and my feelings, she's actively trying to learn about me so we can bond and it's working! For the first time in years I feel like she sees me as an individual instead of the person she wanted be to be. When we went to the mall to spoil ourselves after a hard week, instead of focusing on trying to get me to wear feminine clothes, she helped me find masculine clothing that I'd like and I'm so happy, she understands my special interests and hyperfixations and tries to learn about them to understands why I like it so much! She's also starting to understand how to take care of me as a nerodivergant person, she's being more gentle and is actually helping me when I'm overwhelmed or disassociating. I'm so excited and happy, I thought she'd never understand me or try to figure me out as a person and that I'd have to cut her off. But after she saw how much I was hurting, I think she finally realized that she needed to change, I finally have my mother back and I'm so so happy!"

"Do you genuinely love or at least like your job? If yes, I want to hear from you I grew up in an environment where work was often seen as a necessary struggle, something people *had* to do but rarely enjoyed. For the longest time, I thought that was just how it worked‚Äîjobs weren‚Äôt meant to make you happy.

 I‚Äôm trying to unlearn some of those old beliefs, but it‚Äôs hard when those ‚Äòparental voices‚Äô in your head keep telling you otherwise

So, I‚Äôm looking for inspiration from find people who actually enjoy what they do. If that‚Äôs you, I‚Äôd love to know:

* What do you love about your work?
* What‚Äôs your favorite part of your job?
* How does it excite or fulfill you?"
"Great weekend planned by my husband too see lights!  Great weekend all around!

Holidays can be stressful and this time of year I really miss my mom, brother, and rainbow babies (RIP)...... However my husband was super sweet and planned a nice Christmas light drive for us! When I was little we used to go and look at the lights around town while blasting music and drinking hot chocolate, so that's what my husband did. He even took it one step forward and got is matching Christmas shirts. It's the little things but it meant soooo much that I mentioned this one old tradition (like 3 years ago) and he put effort in to plan it and drive us through several neighborhoods with phenomenal light shows!

We were making breakfast this morning and they were singing and dancing while we listened to music together, and I couldn't look away. I'm so happy that I get to be theirs forever."

I walked by and saw her Harry Potter book (Sorcerors Stone) and we chatted about it real quick! I told her I am also rereading the series and I am on Chamber of Secrets right now! She said she wants to read Prisoner of Azkaban as that is her favorite, I told her that is also one of my favorites except that that one does not have Voldemort in it! She also mentioned the upcoming TV series which I am NOT looking forward to! But thats okay! Oh god I wish me and her could chat about HP all day long! "

"5-month progress: Cutting down my Screen time was one of the best decisions of my life (Thanks to my girlfriend and Discipulus)  A few months ago, I shared how I cut my screen time 8h 55m to just 1h 25m. It‚Äôs been 5 months, so I figured it‚Äôs time for an update!  

Now, let me spill the tea on how cutting my screen time has seriously changed my life:

1. **More Time for the Good Stuff:** Less time scrolling = more time doing things I actually love, like swimming, reading, studying, or just hanging out with my favorite people. Oh, and the focus? Unreal. I can now get through tasks without a million distractions pulling me away.

2. **Bye-Bye, FOMO:** Turning off constant notifications and ditching the mindless scrolling felt SO freeing. I‚Äôm no longer glued to what everyone else is doing, and honestly? I‚Äôm way happier just living in the moment and doing my own thing.

3. **Sleep = Leveled Up:** Cutting out phone time at night was a game-changer. I wake up feeling rested (finally!) and ready to tackle the day. My bedtime routine now feels like a cozy ritual instead of a late-night doom-scroll marathon.

4. **Actually Being Present:** Whether I‚Äôm on a walk, vibing to music, watching anime, or spending time with my loved ones, I‚Äôm all in. No more multitasking with my phone in one hand and half-paying attention. My focus has gone from meh to next level‚ÄîI can actually sit and read or study for hours now.

5. **Me and My Phone = Healthy Boundaries:** My phone? It‚Äôs a tool now, not a time-suck. I only use it intentionally, and that little shift has made my days feel so much more productive and meaningful. Bonus: My anxiety and stress have plummeted.

6. **Stronger Connections:** I‚Äôve gotten so much closer to the people around me. Conversations feel deeper, and those phone-free moments (especially before bed) remind me how special undistracted time really is.

7. **SO Much Extra Time:** Cutting my screen time has freed up so many hours of my life. I feel so much lighter, knowing I don‚Äôt have to carry my phone everywhere. Morning walks with my sister? Just vibes. No distractions, just enjoying the moment.

**Real Talk:**  
The past few months haven‚Äôt been all sunshine and rainbows. I‚Äôve been struggling with some pretty tough depression, and during sleepless nights, my phone became a way to cope and quiet my dark thoughts. But the good news? I‚Äôve slowly been getting back into my healthy sleep routine over the past few weeks. Progress is progress.  

Lastly, I want to thank my girlfriend for her unwavering support throughout this journey and Discipulus for writing that transformative article that made a huge impact on my life."
"I auditioned for an acting role an didn't let my anxiety stop me!! 
I'm already in the thespian troupe of My school, so I've done this before. I've gotten a lead, a minor role and ensemble in a musical we did. I've also worked booth.

But this year, we're doing a show called Mouse Trap and I was scared to audition, since there's only 6 people acting. I tried out for it for sure, wrote Mt own monologue, and got it over with. I think I did good! "
"I think I overcame my depression for the first time  
For the last few years I think I‚Äôve been depressed. Things I used to enjoy didn‚Äôt feel the same or quickly became bland. But today I woke up feeling motivated to actually study for my exam. I felt this indescribable feeling that made me want to grin (something I‚Äôve never felt in my 21 years of life. I also have a rbf). I realized that this must be what it feels like to be happy and I cried. I feel like a hyper puppy with all this energy and I just needed to share this moment with someone. "
I'm a regular at this cat caf√© and I acquired a new scarf This one rarely is cuddly but today was his day. I feel so honored to have gained his trust over time^^
"Small Victory: Finally spoke up for myself, told someone how I REALLY felt!  I had this old acquaintance from highschool who has talked to me many times in the past ‚Äî but all of those attempts ended in him making me uncomfortable, so I‚Äôd break it off. 

He reached out again but this time I did reply, but before we talked for a while, I had the guts/courage to tell him how I feel & how I don‚Äôt wish to continue conversation with him. I feel strong for being able to overcome my fear of his reaction. 

I know it may not seem like much, but in my eyes it was something big for me to overcome. I was always scared of rejection or hurt feelings, so I‚Äôd force myself into situations I didn‚Äôt want to, to appease others. But now, I did it! I spoke up!

Just a little victory for a socially anxious womanü§çü§ç"
We moved to a different state far from my husband's side of the family early this year and I was lamenting to my mil how much I missed the local sourdough bakery they have in town. Now she's been sending me care packages with loaves of bread in them. 
I was asked by a girl that goes to school at a makeup institute to be a model for her today.  I feel prettier than I have for a long time and I had no idea my eyes could look like that!
Absolutely enjoying my vacation in Hawaii 
"Cooked an Irish Guinness stew for ~8 hours today and it was a huge hit! It's very rare that everyone (me, wife, 5y and 7y) all go crazy for something.   The kids were inhaling it, and were on their third bowl before I could even sit down properly. 

Just a happy memory with the family, and I highly recommend this recipe! 
 
[https://www.recipetineats.com/irish-beef-and-guinness-stew/](https://www.recipetineats.com/irish-beef-and-guinness-stew/)

I added less beef and more bacon (as I was low on beef, definitely more beef next time!) and some leeks, but that's about it.  Served over a nice and buttery white rice, but potatoes would be awesome too.

It's a very forgiving recipe if you're looking for a nice slow cooked stew.  

Edit, oh and yeah the  ~3 minutes for the onion and garlic is a joke as usual for recipes.  I cooked them for at least 15 minutes on low/medium heat, and then another 15+ on medium/high with the bacon until they lost most of their water and got nice and brown. 

Cheers!"

"4 + inches of snow overnight and my dogs are in heaven.  Overnight we had a small snowstorm. Between 4 to 5 inches of wet, heavy snow was dumped on us. This made for an interesting drive home from work and some intense clearing the walks when I got home from work. My dogs, however, are in heaven. We did about 3 miles in this stuff and they played the entire time. I have to admit, this snow made everything beautiful. I told my wife that we may need to pick up a used snowmobile and really have fun."

Chip your pets! Our lost cat found after 16 months  16 months ago one of our cats got out of the house. Last week we got a call from a local vet that she had been located. She was only half a mile away. A family moved into a house in September and the kids started taking care of her as an outdoor pet. Eventually their mom got ahold of her and took her in to get scanned and now she‚Äôs home. Thought this was worth sharing. Attached is a photo of us reporting her missing and the other is her safe at home.

"Found a clinic that might be able to make having a baby a reality.  My husband has two perfect babies that were born before we met. He got a vasectomy after his daughter was born. We are very close and I‚Äôve had them since they were very young. 

After about a year and a half of dating we decided we‚Äôd like a baby that belonged to both of us. Reversing a vasectomy is crazy expensive - about 10k which is just money we don‚Äôt have. 

I told myself if we weren‚Äôt able to start trying by next summer I‚Äôd pull the plug and be happy with the kiddos we have and be ok with freedom in our early 40s. 

We found a clinic charging about 3k for a reversal. I get a 3k bonus in June. Feels like fate. "

"Today My dad met his Bio-father after over 50 years of searching‚Ä¶ And it was amazing. There were struggles, Bio-dad has Alzheimer‚Äôs, and the meeting we may have wanted can‚Äôt be. So it goes. But the family‚Ä¶. His brother and sister‚Ä¶ were incredible. Loving and warm and inviting. My dad got to feel accepted in away he never has before. 

He‚Äôs felt a hole in his life for so long. Like this was missing and it was exacerbated by his mom who is a piece of work that lied about his father‚Äôs identify for 48 years. Which fuck you just don‚Äôt do to a kid‚Ä¶. And then continue so long in to adult hood. 

And he heard stories, and learned how alike he and  his dad are and he and his brother HAVE THE SAME DAMN EYES this sort of light blue grey that‚Äôs sharp and piercing. His father and he have the same laugh (deep, from the belly) and his sister has a warmth and wit that was so familiar.  

His step mom (doesent feel right, but easiest descriptor) was amazing. You could  easily see her being  conflicted  that her husband of 50 years had a child she didn‚Äôt know about‚Ä¶. Never. She was supportive from the minute she heard. She wanted them to meet for both their sakes. (Also her Apple cake is phenomenal) 

It was bitter sweet in some  ways but ultimately‚Ä¶ today was beautiful. It was a step in healing and a piece of his identity he has wanted for so long. 

Today was amazing and I‚Äôm happy as hell"
"Im down 43.5 pounds for the year and really wanted to share Did my monthly weigh in to find that im down 43.5 pounds for the year. This last January i weighed in at the heaviest ive ever been, 371.1. Ive been extremely overweight and obese since the pandemic. Id been gaining weight in college before that but the pandemic took it out of control. 


I weighed in today at 328.6
I haven't weighed this low in 2 years


My goal is 250. Not my permanent goal but if i can get there, i think ill have the discipline to train my body to do that i want to do and feel the way i want to feel about my body. Its taken a lot of self love and support from my partner to get where i am but ive got a long road ahead of me.

‚ÄúI chase my wife every day. I want her to be impressed by me, think I‚Äôm sexy, find me intellectually attractive, have feelings for me. We work at our relationship and that is a chase. It is thrilling to have your long term partner who knows everything about you to still get butterflies about you. I will chase that feeling from her every day I have.

"Full plot twist (mental health talk, my darkest time turned out to be an opportunity to heal) **Context:**  
Apprenticeship ends, exams in progress, and I recently moved houses. My safety network fell apart completely, and I have a long history of mental illness. Stress and self-hatred overtook me, leading to a tough moment. I ended up in the hospital for a day after trying something stupid, but I've come out the other side.

**The Twist (Things are looking up!):**

* **Therapy & Help:** I‚Äôve confirmed that I need help, and I now have access to therapy, including a full day treatment block (diagnosis and long-term strategies).
* **Time for Healing:** Next month, I‚Äôll be taking a few weeks off work. I also have 2 months off in spring for condensed treatment, and I'll be getting paid much better due to a new contract. My finances are a bit of a mess right now, but I‚Äôm working on it.
* **Physical Health:** I have a treatment scheduled for fall that is physical (not mental health), which will get me a month off for sick leave.
* **Big Events Ahead:** I have concerts to look forward to (Linkin Park, Imminence‚Äîboth bands that kept me alive during 2024) and running events (half marathon), plus some traveling across the country.
* **Sobriety Journey:** I‚Äôve decided to leave alcohol behind and become fully sober. I‚Äôve already gone 13 days without drinking!
* **Transformation:** 2025 is going to be MY YEAR. I‚Äôm changing my appearance as a symbol of everything I‚Äôve gone through. I‚Äôve already fixed my teeth (cavities filled) this week, and next up is a hair chop!"

"I overcame my dysfunctional attachment patterns and finally have the love I always wanted! It's been almost 3 years and we're still happy together! We talk openly, our routine is enjoyable, the sex is amazing. I love her deeply, respect her and wish to marry her! I see her in my future and I trust her completely, I'm able to forgive her for her mistakes and I see her aligned with me, I've never had that before. I really admire this women and everything we built together. 

After so much trauma, failed relationships and a lot of therapy I finally found the love of my life, she's my family. I'm not saying it's easy, it's not. Every day I get over the negative things my brain generates to be able to be the person she deserves me to be, so I can have the life I deserve. Sometimes, I can't even believe this is my reality. I'm so happy and just felt like sharing this.

To everyone navigating the emotional rollercoaster of life: things can get better. Be patient, and don't let the right person slip away. Give love and allow yourself to receive love."
"SO very disappointed with delivery food.. until TODAY! I've cooked healthy meals my entire life... This past month I hurt my back and was laying in bed for about 4-5 days wincing in agony. I decided to sign up to Uber Eats and very lazily and SHOCKINGLY expensively order some food.

30 years ago, in a small town I used to live in, was the best Chinese food I ever had. It wasn't overly MSG, greasy, cheap etc. something about it just screamed quality and flavour.

Bad Chinese put me onto ordering Thai, Indian or even Vietnamese over Chinese.. Literally 20 years since I had Chinese I was feeling a bit nostalgic and in need of comfort food. So, last week I went for it 

Well, it wasn't ""terrible"" but I wouldn't order it again.

This evening, I don't know what came over me. The cost of these delivery apps is utterly insane. 2 burgers and fries from Five Guys costs ¬£42 !!!

But, let's face it, you're not paying for the food, you're paying to be lazy as fuck and get food delivered just inches from your face without having to move a muscle except to open your door.

Anyway, my selection of five items arrived and hour ago. I was immediately confused because there were so many boxes. Turns out, they have thrown in free prawn crackers and free vegetable spring rolls. Very thoughtful! And, you can't have Chinese without dissolving prawn crackers in sweet and sour sauce!

This was exactly the same items as the last place, but the quality was such an ENORMOUS step up 

My mouth has rarely been so happy with a dinner. This was exactly the comfort food I was hoping for. It has totally reinvigorated my interest in Chinese after 20 years of being out of by cheap orange sugar sauce, MSG and just general uninspiring dishes.. where you've had one, you've had them all, just not in ""pork"" flavour.

So, there's my ""Happy Rant"" !

My back even feels a lot better by dumping so much happy food related dopamine into my bloodstream... And MSG I guess. I have no idea how it affects people's CNS, but it absolutely does. It's more of a hormone than a good üòÇ"

"i finally decided i‚Äôm going to go to the gym with my friend and i couldn‚Äôt be more excited  so for the longest time i was against going to the gym, the grunting, the sweat, men, it‚Äôs just not a place i see myself liking to be around. i have really bad social anxiety and i don‚Äôt really have any body issues, i mean sometimes im astounded by the amount of space i take up, but overall im very happy with how i look. im not going to the gym for any physical reason other than the fact i have like hip pain and my doctor told me exercise should help. im pretty young (18) so joint and muscle pain shouldn‚Äôt be something im dealing with yet here i am. i‚Äôm mostly going to help with anxiety, i struggle a lot from generalized anxiety and medical anxiety and ocd tendencies. (woops) so it finally feels good to take care of myself in a way i can control. i‚Äôm also excited to be more socially attractive. i‚Äôm thinking of this as like a revenge body but for my past self, like my past self would be so upset i caved and im going to start working out. 

i will say i have no idea how to work out or do anything at the gym, i think im just gonna stair master and do the leg thing until im bored. i‚Äôll probably ask my friend what to do, he‚Äôs a physical trainer. idk, im just excited to be going in the first place. i‚Äôm gonna take progress pics obviously because i wanna see how i look in a year.y main issue as of right now is that i dont know what to wear to the gym, i dont have any athletic pants nor do i want any, texture issue, do i just get sweatpants? i dont have any, would it be cringe to go in pajama pants? who‚Äôs to say! i may go in jeans, the world is my oyster, and it‚Äôs 2 in the morning. goodnight!

"Finally getting the help I need in a psych hospital  Finally opening up 

I've been in a psych hospital for a month now, currently outpatient, and things are getting better!

I received very bad news today.
usually I shut down and push everyone away when I'm sad & angry at myself. But today I didn't, I talked about it with a nurse and she really helped me, showed me a new skill and even made me laugh! 

The skill helped a ton and by the end I was laughing!

I am proud of myself for finally getting the help I need, finally opening up and just telling someone who can actually help me how I truly feel.
Had I stayed home which I wanted to do this morning,  I would've ended up sh'ing.

I am happy, I'm slowly taking steps forward 
Yay me ^_^"
"Meditated every day for 116 days straight! üéâ I never thought I‚Äôd be someone who could stick with a habit for this long, but here I am‚Äî116 days of meditation in a row. It started small, just 2 minutes a day, but tracking it in Mainspring habit tracker app kept me motivated to keep going.

At first, it felt like a chore, but now it‚Äôs something I actually look forward to. It‚Äôs helped me feel calmer, more focused, and way less stressed. Honestly, I‚Äôm just proud of myself for showing up every day.

"i made up with a friend after messing up our friendship all because of my alters for context i have D.I.D and this will come in handy soon.

i had done some pretty fucked up things to a friend of mine and i could not forgive myself at all. after awhile of me being sad one of my little space alters who we'll call N rn reached out to my friend we'll call L. see to N, L was like his father he loved him so much and he was mad at me that i told him he couldnt speak to L anymore so he started to text L on my discord.

N and one of my other alters we'll call J used to talk to him all the time so they got to talking again. my alter J would talk to L almost daily for about 3-4ish days. they would talk for a long time then be on their way. J asked L if he wanted to add her {me} on a game me and him used to play called VRchat. he said sure and later they started to hangout. after sometime J asked if I wanted to talk to L and I was scared shitless, ofc I wanted to but god was I scared to face the music. we start talking and after an hour of a serious convo we started to talk about the past and all the things we loved. i for once laughed and smiled truly and it was all thanks to my alters. i couldnt be more happy"

"I had a great conversation with a friend that made me feel so free Conversations where you feel like the other person really gets you, specially when it's about something you have kept in for so long, thinking other people will judge you for it, but when you do end up sharing it, you're met with nothing but understanding, they heal you so much. You finally realised it's okay. It's like the opposite of having a panic attack. Today I had the luxury of such a conversation. I feel full. "

"Toddler Randomly Adopts My Mom at a Rest Stop On our way home from a lil road trip today, my family and I stopped at a service station to stretch and take a break. While my mom and I were waiting for my dad near the entrance, she noticed this adorable toddler (maybe 1‚Äì2 years old) and gave a little wave and said hi.

This kid was so cute‚Äîbig eyes, total lack of self-preservation lmao- and out of nowhere, she just runs at my mom with her arms up like she‚Äôs known her forever. My mom instinctively picks her up and checks with her parents and they‚Äôre just like, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs ok, it looks like she loves you!‚Äù Meanwhile, this tiny koala of a child clings to my mom and gives her this little nod like, yeah, you‚Äôre my person now.

It was the most unexpectedly wholesome thing. My mom was so touched‚Äîit‚Äôs amazing how a moment of pure, innocent connection like that can make you feel so appreciated.

Just wanted to share this sweet little experience on a day of gratitude. Happy Thanksgiving, y‚Äôall! "
"my (F20) first romantic experience-- summer 2024 this happened a few months ago, but it was a really good memory for me.



I'll preface this by saying that unfortunately the relationship didn't work out-- I was traveling at the time, so it couldn't last. But I hope I'll see him in the future.



Over the summer, I (F20) was traveling, and I met this guy (M24) while volunteering. I asked him out by requesting to ride his motorcycle to fulfill a bucketlist item, as he was the only person I knew who had a bike. He said yes and took me out for a ride. We went to a romantic beach location (which he later said he wasn't planning to be romantic, it was just a good distance for riding). We talked for a while and got along, and eventually he kissed me under the stars. It was my first kiss, which I had tried not to develop high expectations for, but I'm a hopeless romantic, and I had spent a long time wondering what it would be like.



I suggested going back to his place, and he was very sweet, trying to make sure I was comfortable. I knew I wanted to lose my virginity, and I felt confident about it. So I slept with him, and I had such a great time learning about this new side of life that I had never experienced before. We talked for hours throughout the night, learning more about each other and laughing a lot.



We continued dating for a few weeks until I had to leave, and that was actually really difficult, as we had gotten more attached than expected. But I'm trying to feel grateful for the experiences I've had, and this was absolutely one of the best experiences. Don't be sad that it's over, be glad it happened :)"

I got my truck, my job, college around the corner. It feels like I can finally start living again. Honestly these past few years were the worst, but now they were all just lessons for me.

"Diet soda is amazing!! Feels like a cheat code I‚Äôve only tried diet soda once and hated it

Stopped having sodas ages ago (health), and only have water now

Well, on a whim I decided to try a diet soda again and my god!! There so many options these days!!

It feels like a cheat code in life, this shouldn‚Äôt be allowed.

Coming from water this stuff tastes amazing!!

I was so happy about this ‚Äúdiscovery‚Äù that this store worker and I started comparing notes on our favorite diet sodas.

Just felt like sharing this insignificant thing that‚Äôs honestly made me so much happier lol. I love it

Hope your day is going well!

"I just presented my work with Doctors Without Borders to my CEO and entire company, overcoming the panic attacks that I‚Äôve been having for over a year ‚ù§Ô∏èüî• Hey all, I work for an agency that does work for some major nonprofits, one being DWB. 

I‚Äôve been here for a while and had a panic attack early being at this company and have been completely stuck and living in fear of presenting ever since then (more than a year). 

I love my job and my work, but I‚Äôve been so nervous that doing better would lead to more presentations and it‚Äôs been some of the roughest times of my life and career. I couldn‚Äôt present a single slide without freezing and feeling like I was going to die or my heart would beat out of my chest. 

I‚Äôve been doing intense trauma therapy ever since that initial panic attack and CHOSE to present today when I could have said no. 

BUT I DID üî•

I was able to overcome the panic and present my work with power and pride. I think this is the largest turning point in my career, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. 

I just needed to tell someone, because this has been the largest, most invisible struggle of my life without exception. 

And I see the light at the end of the tunnel, I overcame the panic this time I can do it again.

I'm glad she did it because i would have never been able to work up the nerve, but neither of actually knew how to kiss so we just kind of ended up laughing and cuddling. Afterwards all day today I've had this massive grin on my face and i genuinely could not thinking about it to the point i can't sleep. She said I make her nervous, I think that's a compliment, the whole time I could not form a coherent sentence. She's genuinely perfect and I don't know how I managed to end up with her."

I‚Äôm not sure what triggered it but it got to the point where I had to go on antibiotics. I couldn‚Äôt itch my face, I couldn‚Äôt emote without pain, it felt like everyone was looking at me. But after 6 months of using panoxyl, I have almost no acne. I can look at myself in the mirror again, I don‚Äôt feel like everyone is judging me or think I‚Äôm gross. I can furrow my brows and smile and screw my eyes shut and it doesn‚Äôt hurt. I still have a lot of acne scars but at this point I don‚Äôt care.

We‚Äôre going to get married, we want to buy a house together and maybe adopt a child or two someday!

We both work hard in our job fields and coming together we really have a chance at a comfortable happy life together.

I‚Äôm going to spoil him myself, I‚Äôve got some cool ideas I think he‚Äôd love. My past partners were so bah humbug about the holidays and it was really disheartening for me at the time because I grew up loving the holiday regardless of not being very religious.

"I've been at one of the most pivotal points in my life and it's been overwhelming incredible I've been on another Reddit fix of late. Like all things, it'll pass, but it's okay to be here right now. There's no way I can rave without sounding like I'm bragging, but that's okay too. It's nice feeling pride. It's nice embracing myself in a way I never did before, even if it feels eccentric at times. This sort of post is how I think and feel all of the time, and I've held it back because I have spent so long trying to figure out the ""right"" way to be.

I'm sitting here in the quiet, not quite lonely but happily melancholic. Can't think of a better description, alas. I'm now with the woman I think I want to spend the rest of my life with. I thought it before but that past me just liked the attention and wanted to be loved more than anything else, no matter how else I showed up in those relationships. I'll be heartbroken if this changes but I accept the idea, gotta be healthy about it, yeah? She's away for the weekend, and I'm rather excited for the opportunity to miss her. How lovely to have somebody to miss.

We had some talks come up about possible incompatibilities and that's given me confidence too. Being able to so openly communicate. I had to prepare myself for the idea that if we worked out long-term then I would be a stepfather. A dad. I always wanted to be one but was too scared of myself. What if I never worked past my issues? What if I repeated the abusive mistakes of my family?

I think I'm ready. If I wasn't, I wouldn't have started dating her because that wouldn't be very kind to either of us. It revitalized the topic in my head of how I want to show up for the world and for myself and I'm excited by the nebulous ideas forming in my head. But they aren't new ideas either, they're what I've been working towards this entire time.

How glad I am to be here. 2 years ago I was blindly stuck in an abusive relationship. She was a lovely woman who was hurting herself more than me, but she was also abusive and that should have been my takeaway the entire time. But I was so ready to hate and blame myself that I took on so much hurt, to the detriment of both of us.

Then, after a chaotic night, I finally started the separation process. And I realized I had been in such a dark place. I spent that night outside laying in the ice and snow just...adrift. No family, no friends, no drive, about to cut off the family I had been so happy to be a part of. The stereotypical man with no support network. But like the mantra that stopped me from ending it all while I was in high school, I had studied enough sociology and psychology to know it was possible to work past it, no matter how I felt in the moment.

Hah, the amount of times my therapist said I was disassociating from my feelings. She was right every time. I argued with myself and my perceptions constantly. How could I be right, a good person, if I were treated the way I was as a child? I must have deserved it all somehow, because what other answer could there be? I wish something like me could have been there for him, but I can at least be that person now.

A grandfather of mine has been reaching out, not even my biological grandfather but still such a lovely man. I didn't think so at first, just a vague feeling of being weirded out because I was so on guard about my family. I wish it hadn't taken me so long to give him a chance, because he blew away all of my preconceptions. And now I have to grumble at the idea of removing ""doesn't have a family"" from my identity. It's oddly annoying, but what a fun character flaw to shave off.

I started becoming a part of communities again at the beginning of last year, and I'm really seeing the benefits now. I have a good reputation, people like me, some people admire me, people trust me. I'm crying right now because I just...never thought I could be perceived like that. And I can now look back and see how much of myself I've always been, I just wasn't able to believe it.

But I didn't want to just become a kind nice boi. Oh no, I've had far too much violence in my life for that. I wanted to make the world better, and in my mind that means being able to deal with conflicts. I don't think everybody should have to be able to deal with conflicts, but I want to. It saddens me the amount of people I saw growing up who saw my sentimental and emotional nature as some kind of weakness, and how they weakened themselves by stifling it.

So I've been practicing how to disagree and confront people while still being curious and kind. And it's been incredible, I want to keep doing it. It's so amazing seeing people so animated talking to me. No I haven't managed to immediately change someone's mind, but I could never have the conversations I've had if that were my primary focus. I won't harp on anyone who disagrees with that part, different tactics and all. I've practiced a bit online now and then to help get past the inevitable shakes that came from a childhood of having to hold myself back in fear.

I changed my name shortly after graduating high because I wasn't happy with who I was. My new name represented all of the characteristics I wanted to be. Most of my life I would have said I hadn't gotten there yet. But I was wrong, I was him the entire time, I'm so grateful I learned to love myself enough to see that.

I have made mistakes, I still am making mistakes, and I will keep on making them. And that's okay. I'm just so glad to be here. I'm glad that I at least trusted myself enough to try. I can't wait to see what the future holds, and I look forward to seeing what I can do to help it."
"Caught my boyfriend telling his cousin abt the plan for my proposal yesterday!! I knew it was coming, we already consider ourselves engaged, but to know that he‚Äôs planning the big thing is so surreal! "
"First time trying hotpot with my friends; ordered foods that are rare for me to taste and I had such a good time!! 
Me and my friends decided to eat hotpot and it's my first time so I expect so much. I ordered some beef, squid ball and etc! I'm so happy and my tummy too!!! ü§£ Also, the songs inside the restaurant are really for party songs so I enjoyed the time and I will surely never forget this first time of mine!!! ü©∑

I also bought a chocolate ice cream as we're walking towards the parking. Random moments like those really makes me soft, cause I know it will be one of the moments that I enjoyed a good company, good food and everyone is just living in the moment. "
Warm coffee on a crisp cold morning. Watching the sunrise over the mountains. Mornings like this are always fantastic. Wintertime is so beautiful. Love getting to wake up and see this view every day.
I looked at this enchanting landscape for a long time and decided to repeat it in compositions of dried flowers to preserve this feeling for a long time. I think I succeeded. 
"I am so thankful for my parents this year. üíï  My mom and my dad. We were sorting jelly beans and trying to guess what flavors they were. I will always remember times like these. I am forever thankful for them. How they always taught me to be kind and humble. I am so grateful that I have parents at all.

"After years of trauma and debt i might actually afford myself a real christmas present I‚Äôve been in foster homes all my life and only a year ago moved into my own place

It was incredibly difficult and ended in big debt. My life has been so depressing trying to live one day at a time 

I got a well paying job and through tips got a little extra money the last few months. I think it‚Äôs entirely possible I‚Äôm getting a nice expensive gift for myself and I‚Äôm over the moon!!!"
"Grateful for the moments to experience live music  Music makes me happy. It always has. I connect to certain lyrics, and some beats permeate my soul. And at my core, no matter how mean people are, or how dark life can be, I know music will bring me back to a safe place. And when Im around like minded people, like at this festival, my heart soars and, almost as one, we embrace the moment, in all its raw endorphin inducing energy, and let our minds and bodies freely flow to the beats. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Grateful for the opportunity to go to these events and dance my butt off üòÜ"
"My dog and cat are sleeping in my bed with me My dog is a great dane and he really likes pets so he comes in my bed sometimes. My cat also really likes attention but rarely comes to sit in peoples laps. But today, they are both sitting on my bed and it makes me very happy."
"I got an old paycheck from earlier in the year today  Today my sister cleaned off the kitchen table, there was some junk on it. Like a big pile of papers and old mail. There was an envelope in there for me and it was a paycheck! I did some seasonal work back in May for three days and that was the check they sent me! I remember being on the lookout for it back in June but then I forgot about it! It seems someone in my house (either mom or my brother) who check the mail sometimes forgot to give it to me! I am a tad annoyed about it but happy really. I DID get paid from my job today so I have money but with that extra 75 dollars (lol) that can really help me a lot right now. Like next week which is not payweek. BUT I really want to deposit it NOW, just to make my bank balance go up again! Decisions decisions lol. "
I made a new friend in college for the first time!! So I had a friend group in hs and my life kinda got turned upside down around and long story short I lost all my friends. Anyway in college now and I‚Äôm graduating my bachelors my second year of attending. And because I fast tracked everything ( mostly for living and money reasons) I never made a college friend.  Plus I‚Äôve never made friends my age. I work in an office with people way older than me and I made some class friends that didn‚Äôt turn into real friends that all happened to be in their thirties so didn‚Äôt do great for interacting with people my own age. But I made a friend yesterday at a networking thing who invited me (on LinkedIn lol) to a college ran ‚Äúevent‚Äù tonight. And it was so fun. I‚Äôve never found anyone that was my people and I‚Äôm so happy. The fact that I didn‚Äôt have any friends and also never made any friends in college and was about to leave without doing so was weighing on me. So I‚Äôm very happy and finally feel like I have some type of closure on this aspect of my life.
"Meeting the artist that got me through the darkest time in my life I'm typing this with tears rolling down my cheeks. I can't remember the last time I've ever been this happy. I just needed to put it somewhere which is why I'm writing this. I also don't want to specify the artist just because he's someone a lot of people make fun of the way he looks or they think his music is bad and I just want to share this without judgement. 

Last night I saw my favorite artist live in concert, and attended a meet and greet with him. I was so nervous to ask him for a hug but I'm so glad I did. I don't think I'll ever forget what it felt like to be held by him. It wasn't even like a side hug or an air hug, he wrapped his arms around me and gave me a little squeeze. It keeps replaying in my head.

When I found this artist, I was struggling so deeply. I was addicted to pills, almost failing out of college, and just got broken up with by my first love. Things felt so dark and then I found his music and it resonated with me so deeply. I started watching interviews of him and following him on social media and I quickly learned his character. A lot of the time, especially in the genre this artist is in, the music is good but the artist is really shitty. Not him. 

I'm still processing that this really happened. He was so kind. I told him how much he means to me and he thanked me and shared kind words. I already said this, but I haven't been this happy in so long. I know when I'm having a hard time, I'll be able to think about last time and feel a little bit better. I feel so blessed."
"Almost forgot it‚Äôs my birthday‚Ä¶ but you have an awesome friend who picked you up from home for a birthday lunch treat. Too sweet. Happy birthday, too, to everyone born today. "
"My mom‚Äôs boyfriend came back and has become my dad My mom first started dating this guy when I was about 9 or 10, right after my parent‚Äôs divorce. He moved in soon after, and we (My mom, brother, and I) lived with him for years. We moved a lot back then, and at one point him and my mom bought property together. This fell out pretty hard for them, causing a lot of strain on their relationship. He never got very close with myself or my brother, and eventually they broke up‚Äîleaving the house they built. Year or so later, my dad kicks me out of the house, I‚Äôm 14. I had officially lost all paternal figures in my life. Fast forward to now, about 3? ish months ago he and my mom got back together. Suddenly he was back in my life, and we started actually bonding. I struggle really hard with academics, but due to some life changes, I started doing a lot better. I recently got my report card from school and he was so proud of me keeping my grades up that he gave me $20, and put it up on the fridge. Just like a real dad should. The phrase ‚ÄúNot stepdad, dad who stepped up‚Äù might be considered corny but he really did do that for me. I‚Äôm proud to say I have a dad again. :)"
"Did a few things. No one's told me they are proud of me though. But oh well.  1. Lost 4 kgs in 32 days. 
I hit rock bottom with 113.5 kgs but I have been consistent and mindful these days.
I have been trying really hard. I gain weight even by breathing but slowly I can see the scale tipping lighter. 
I am 109.4 kgs as of this morning. ü•≥ü•≥
(P.s- I know I have a long long way to go but one day at a time)

2. Made healthier choices. 
Even when I became an emotional mess (harsh words were spoken and then it kinda gets stuck in my head playing in a loop), instead of binge eating like I usually do, I decided to choose healthy. Did not binge eat. Instead had my regular meal with a small slice of cake. 

3. Stopped beating myself up for that choice. 
Usually I would beat myself up for binge eating or even eating a slice of cake out of guilt or self loathing. I am trying to be kind to myself too. I deserve it. 

4. Tried cooking something healthy I saw on internet. Burnt it in my first 2 attempts but I guess 3rd time's really a charm. Got it right and it tasted delicious. 

So yeah. That's all. I hope you have a great day too. ü§ó‚ù§Ô∏è"
We lost power last night and I remembered.... Sometimes it's literally the little things.
"My wife is in complete remission !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Extra exclamation points because post was removed for being too short) 

5 rounds of RCHOP chemotherapy, a very scary CAR T Cell therapy treatment and almost daily doctors appointments for longer than I can remember and we FINALLY got the news she's been fighting for!!

We have a friendsgiving dinner this weekend where we will announce it to our friends, so we are keeping it quiet until then (except close family), but I just had to tell you all. I'm so full of relief and excited energy!

This doesn't mean she's cured, we still need to stay in remission for 5 years for them to tell us that, but there is NO DETECTABLE cancer on any scan or lab or test. We still have to do a stem cell transplant that will mean a month-long hospital stay and 100 days of quarantine, but this news has made it all so worth it.

Big thanks to all of you here whose posts kept me going when things were bad. "

It was pretty beat up so I took it down when I put up my Halloween flag with intention of purchasing the same one again (literally this exact flag in the picture) and haven‚Äôt gotten around to it yet. The Halloween flag actually only came down two days ago, lol.

Haaaaaa *^* he then basically explained to me that he equalized me to an old Hollywood kind of beauty and seeing and talking to me is such a pleasure like seeing a beautiful movie lmao lmaooo I'm so freaking flattered"
"After 23 years of wearing masks, I finally feel like I know who I am  I'm genuinely so happy, like ecstatic!! I've struggled with knowing who I really am and want to be, because I've always just put on a mask and was being whoever people wanted me to be, as a kid I lost myself pretty quickly and never knew who the real me was.

I have an ex of 6 years, who never knew who I really was because of these masks, and once I start peeling the layers back, I found that I was happier as a trans woman, so we inevitably broke up, and I was in a very rough patch mentally. 

I've been in a lot of therapies, and ended up in a psych ward for a few weeks when it got really bad. but I always held onto being trans as a symbol, a symbol that I finally have a small part of who I am. the real me! 

other a few years, I've got a lot better mentally, I've started a new job and started dating, it's been a very mixed bag but it's been fun! 
but yesterday, was the day I finally figured out who I wanted to be. I went on a date with this person, and we went back to their house after a fun evening of playing games at a board game cafe. when we got there, we put on Friday night dinner, we did a puzzle, played with their cats, chatted and laughed throughout the whole night, until 3am! and honestly, I've never felt so happy with who I was, I liked who I was in that moment, and I genuinely loved being around that person! they're amazing, and they have somehow helped me see a side in myself I like and don't consider a mask! I'm genuinely ecstatic!! 
"
"I‚Äôm dating someone who makes me happy. He tells me how much I mean and backs it with actions. Everytime.  Yesterday I watched him shorten a trip by a week because he didn't want to be away from me for so long. And he wants to be here as I start a new semester and a new internship. The trip was planned way before we met and while I would've been ok with him being away, I'm really happy to spend some more time with him. He makes me really happy. And I don't have to question his intentions about me. He tells me every time and backs it with actions. I'm happy here. Kk bye.

"Randomly messaged someone on reddit a few months ago. Now just came back from the happiest week of my life with her (Sunsets that we watched together, to catch some attention) 

A couple months ago, I (m19) randomly messaged a girl (f18) and it was the best decision of my life. I was at a bad and lonely time in life, having just moved away from home, feeling very isolated. I would search NSFW and relationship subreddits looking for anything to feel a connection, but nothing. Out of nowhere, a post gets recommended to me but it's wholesome. Nothing particularly dirty about it, just a random request to chat with someone. Purely out of surprise and curiosity, I messaged her, and there hasn't been a single day since that we haven't spoken. We mesh like we are made for each other in a way that i never thought i could with another human. That was well over three months ago. I drove 400 miles to see her and be with her for a week and it's the happiest both of us have been, ever. We spent a week together going all over the region she's from, adding about another thousand miles onto my car, plus the 400 it took to get there. Already planning our next visit, hoping to have her come to my place for Christmas!! Been super happy about this and needed to share. Ama if you want!! If you have a question for her, I'll direct it her way."

"Chatgpt described me in a very nice way i feel happy :D Here‚Äôs a detailed description of the facial features in the image:



1. **Skin Tone**:  
   The man has a medium to light olive complexion, with smooth and even skin texture. His skin tone has a warm undertone that reflects light moderately.

2. **Forehead**:  
   The forehead is moderately broad, free of visible wrinkles, and the hairline appears natural, though slightly obscured by strands of hair falling slightly forward.

3. **Hair**:  
   The hair is black or dark brown, straight, and has a slightly damp or tousled appearance. It is styled casually, with some strands falling over the forehead, giving a relaxed look.

4. **Eyebrows**:  
   The eyebrows are dark, slightly thick, and naturally shaped. They are not overly defined but frame the eyes well.

5. **Eyes**:  
   The eyes are almond-shaped and moderately sized, with a slightly heavy upper lid that gives them a neutral or slightly tired expression. The irises appear dark, likely brown or black.

6. **Nose**:  
   The nose is straight, with a narrow bridge that slightly widens toward the tip. Its proportions are well-balanced with the other facial features.

7. **Mouth**:  
   The lips are medium-sized. The upper lip has a defined Cupid‚Äôs bow, while the lower lip is slightly fuller. The mouth is relaxed, with a neutral expression.

8. **Chin and Jawline**:  
   The chin is slightly pointed and emphasized by a small patch of facial hair (goatee). The jawline is moderately angular with soft contours, adding balance to the face.

9. **Cheeks**:  
   The cheeks are slightly sunken, subtly highlighting the cheekbones, but they are not overly prominent.

10. **Facial Hair**:  
    There is minimal facial hair, concentrated on a small goatee on the chin and a faint shadow of stubble along the jawline.

11. **Ears**:  
    The ears are not prominent in the image, partially covered by the hair and the angle of the photo.

Let me know if you‚Äôd like anything clarified or if you need this adapted further!"
"The Pink Sunset on the Green Farm, I made this oil painting inspired by an afternoon when I was on the farm walking along a road, I remember looking at it and wanting to freeze that moment, I hope you have a good week :) "
"I sang in public for the first time. I am so glad I am still here. TW: Self-harm, addiction, suicide, depression, eating disorders, abuse

I (24F) have a long history of mental health issues. My mother was emotionally abusive, I had undiagnosed ADHD, and began suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts when I was 10 years old.

The past 10 years have been a fight. I developed an eating disorder and fainted at school. I began to self harm. I have been in and out of therapy and tried many different medications.

At 19, during the pandemic, I began to heavily abuse alcohol. I knew I had a problem but I didn't care. I just wanted the pain to stop.

A year in, I attended an AA meeting at my local church. I have nothing against religion, but for me, it is a huge source of trauma. The group was not advitised as being religious, so it was a shock. I sat there, shaking, slightly tipsy, consumed with shame, fear, self-hatred, and a feeling of dread. I felt I would never be free. I felt I would always be broken. I felt I would never be able to improve and was destined to die from alcoholism or by my own hand. I felt so very alone. I hadn't spoken to my friends in a while- I was convinced everyone hated me.

I realised nothing was ever going to get better, and that my life was not worth living. I felt utterly broken.

Three years later, I finally found a therapist that I feel understands me. I have found the correct combination of medication. I have taken up meditation, exercise, and work two jobs I enjoy. I have hobbies again.

I still struggle, but things are better. I am able to stand the pain without breaking.

I have always loved to sing, so I took up singing lessons. I love it. My teacher told me I have some real talent, and wants to introduce me to some artists who are interested in writing/playing with me.

She puts on this ""concert"" every year, where lots of her students- kids, teenagers, the elderly, a huge range of ages and skill level- will perform a song or piano piece in front of friends and family.

I said no at first, but eventually I realised something. I have come so far, but I am never going to be ""normal"". I am never going to be able to meet a new person without feeling shaky. I am never going to be able to be able to answer the phone without deep breathing first. I am never going to be able to stand up on a stage without feeling like I'll puke or pass out.

But what's the alternative? I never do anything, ever. Because I'm too scared of getting hurt. I lived my life that way for 23 years, hoping to find a cure for all my fear. But that cure doesn't exist. And I don't want to curl up and rot anymore. I want to live, even if it means pain.

""Do it scared"" my therapist said. So that's what I did.

The concert was held in the same church as that horrid AA meeting, all those years ago.

I couldn't sleep the night before, I couldn't eat, and I was shaking so badly I could hardly stand. I'd never sung in public before, and I was terrified. Drinking crossed my mind. Self-harm crossed my mind. Backing out crossed my mind more than once. Self-pity, hatred, loneliness. My mother's voice rang in my head. I did not think anyone would come to support me. It was so small and silly, after all.

But I walked into that church, two years sober, on wobbly legs, and stood on the stage.

And I sang.

My best friend came. She surprised me entirely. She beamed and clapped and cheered along with all the other sweet people who attended. She bought me flowers. I burst into tears later. She hugged me and told me she was so proud of me, that I was amazing. I felt so much love. I used to be so afraid and ashamed to show emotion. Now, it's like I can't stop. And I don't want to.

Hours later, I am staring out at the night sky. I thought I would never be able to do anything like this. And later, I thought I would never be able to do it without alcohol.

If I'd backed out, it wouldn't have been a failing. But I'm so glad I did it.

Three years ago, I was suicidal, an active alcoholic, lonely and afraid.

Today, I am sober, my best friend bought me flowers, and I sung one of my favourite songs in front of 50 people. It was small, but to me it felt so big. And that's okay, isn't it? To give small things significance? I used to wonder why anyone cared when ""nothing really mattered"". But now, now it all matters to me. Because I realised if I don't give the small things meaning, nothing ever really matters at all. And I want them to matter.

I am still afraid. I am still terrified.

But now I know I can do it. Now I know it cannot break me.

When people used to tell me ""it gets better"", I used to think it was bullshit. But now, I understand. For the first time, I truly get it.

I am so grateful today. I know how lucky I am, and my chest feels too small for all the emotion I feel. I always thought that was a flaw in me, to feel so much. Now I feel it is a gift. A double edged sword, but a gift all the same. What a privilidge to be human, and to feel so damn much.

I'm going to keep moving forward, even if I slow to a crawl. I am proud of myself, even if no one else ever is.

My mother's voice is quiet for now. I drowned it out. Something I always longed to do and never thought I ever could. That's proved you wrong, I thought. Because I may be afraid and shaky and small on that stage, but I still stood up and sang. After all these years, I found my voice. And it soared, in that tiny church. My god, it soared.

I'm glad I'm still here. And I am glad I am alive."

Hey Reddit! David French and Michelle Cottle here. We write for New York Times Opinion and have offered commentary on [President Trump‚Äôs appointees](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/opinion/kash-patel-fbi-hoover.html), his [damage to foreign policy](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/opinion/trump-ukraine-zelensky-usaid.html) and the first months of his second term.

From David French: I joined Times Opinion in 2023 and write about law, culture, religion and conflict. I like to explore the story behind the story. What are the reasons for American polarization and dysfunction? Why do so many Americans feel lonely and anxious? Before journalism, I was a commercial litigator and then a constitutional lawyer. My most recent book, ‚ÄúDivided We Fall: America‚Äôs Secession Threat and How to Restore Our Nation,‚Äù outlined the dangers of polarization and the need to engage with people who have opposing viewpoints. You can subscribe [to my newsletter here](https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/david-french).¬†

From Michelle Cottle: I joined The Times in 2018 as the editorial board's national political writer after reporting on the nation's capital as a contributing editor for The Atlantic. Before that, I was a senior writer at National Journal specializing in long-form profiles.¬†I recently reflected on Mitch McConnell‚Äôs legacy, as well as the state of American politics.
